AI walking into our lives. Through the ads that follow us on social media. The personalized pick of movies and shows. Our cars. The maps helping us navigate. Right there in our hands - our super-powerful phones. And now, it's happening again. This time with generative AI. In the form of handy tools - like ChatGPT, MetaAI and Stable Diffusion - that pique our imagination, and stoke our curiosity. Generative AI technology's path into enterprises too has been just as accelerated and enthusiastic, supported by an exponential increase in investments. While almost every enterprise has started working with generative AI, their struggles with data readiness and concerns around regulatory compliance are just as real. A common acknowledgment is that very few of the gen AI pilots, when considered at scale, promise to deliver tangible business value. In the months to follow, we believe, some ongoing AI pilots will scale to strategic AI programs that will then help pave the way for AI-led business transformations. improving the quality of code, and even enhancing personal and organizational productivity. They also clearly see that the advent of generative AI, with potential for more pervasive automation, will accelerate the pace of workforce transformation. Talent, across functions, will need support to imbibe new skills, and some will even prep for entirely new jobs that didn't exist before. Generative AI, if embraced responsibly, could drive productivity growth and support a more sustainable, inclusive world. Our clients, across industries, are looking to solve tough business challenges with generative AI in ways that produce measurable outcomes for them. For example, supporting and personalizing customer interactions, bringing greater efficiencies to marketing and sales,\\n\\nEmbracing AI responsibly also means keeping track of emerging AI regulations across countries and jurisdictions while ensuring compliance. Existing processes, policies, guidelines, and tooling will need to be continuously reviewed and enhanced to cover model assurance, model security, bias, fairness, explainability, reproducibility, training data privacy, safety and alignment, IP/contractual risks and sustainability impact too. We are factoring it all in as we engineer enterprise-scale generative AI developments for our clients.\",\n",

Transforming operations\\n\\nMicrosoft Corporation is a technology company that aspires to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. As a vocal advocate for the game-changing potential of artificial intelligence, Microsoft was eager to harness the power of AI, especially generative AI, to heighten their operational agility. This meant reengineering their operations analytics platform for better quality, faster response, and support. The platform is a trusted resource for several thousand users at Microsoft, offering insights and transactions support to manage their business operations across commercial, OEM, and partner channels. To amplify and transform the platform with generative AI, Microsoft teamed up with Infosys. while simultaneously addressing pitfalls preemptively and making efficiency projections. The aim was to transform the platform to meet changing user needs at a revolutionary rate. The outcome was a whopping 35% reduction in development effort and a 24% reduction in test-case generation and code review time. In fact, the platform was ready to deliver on Microsoft's operational aspirations six months ahead of schedule! Infosys brought the capabilities of Azure OpenAI Service and GitHub Copilot to help solve this challenging problem. They also brought best practices for leveraging generative AI technologies for code generation and development support. Infosys used these techniques and started to reengineer the platform, factoring in user feedback\\n\\nThe renewed operations platform delivers never-beforeseen on-time, on-demand intelligence for users with hugely reduced data latency and cost across the 150+ reports of operational insights that the business counts on. The new generative AI-powered knowledge repository enables the platform's support team to provide quicker responses to queries, resulting in an 18% reduction in support ticket volume. This newfound agility, along with the self-service capabilities added to the platform, has resulted in a sharp increase in internal customer satisfaction. 'Successful operations are all about effective support for the business, firmly grounding the core technology to make that possible, and being able to pivot with agility to meet changing market needs.\",\n",

In the summer of 2023, the Bank announced its Forward '28 strategy to strengthen the organization and create a more focused business trajectory to exceed its financial targets. With the maturing of generative AI, Danske Bank was quick to see its potential to revolutionize their industry and transform the way their own company operated, to increase efficiency and productivity, reduce costs, and open up new opportunities for growth. They were keen to start to explore a custom GPT indexed with their own business content to automate repetitive tasks and provide instant responses to tactical pursuits, freeing up human staff to focus on more strategic objectives. while\\u00a0maintaining an abundance of caution that provides the guardrails to manage ethical and practical safeguards for issues like AI hallucinations. Microsoft's Open AI services in Azure provided the foundation. From start to pilot, the solution was ready in about six weeks, and soon scaled for ethical and safe use for about 3,000 users. Infosys responded with a plan to help Danske Bank set up an A-team and the appropriate generative AI technology to build a secure, ethical-by-design chatbased assistant - DanskeGPT. The intent was to prototype and scale a solution to accelerate personal productivity, first in a sandboxed environment for experimentation,\\n\\nToday, Danske Bank's entire employee base is harnessing DanskeGPT's capabilities to assist them in their everyday activities - already seeing a 10-15% boost in productivity in some areas. Team Infosys continues to work, enhancing DanskeGPT with internal data, to deliver for Danske Bank new content, and enable new process improvements through effective ways of employing this flexible assistant. The team is also helping the Bank to quickly identify the parts of their business where the technology could have the most immediate impact.\",\n",

The initial hyperventilation of AI doomerism and the risk of human extinction by AI advances like Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) has quietened down. People have accepted that, like any other general-purpose technology be it electricity, nuclear energy, the internet or even a discovery like fire, gen AI has enormous potential for good when explored and advanced within the guardrails of responsibility. Besides, many of the doomsday prophets pleading for extensive AI regulation have revealed themselves to be just protectionists who want to limit the fruits of gen AI to a few companies and investors. It is also clear that there won't be a scenario where we'll have 'one model to rule them all' . Every day brings new advances in large language models from a dizzying set of actors all pushing for greater innovation. These range from very large models which need massive computing infrastructure to small ones that can run locally on the phone. The real power of AI will come from configuring all the different models and tools to get the best solutions. This is not very different from previous generations of technology. What's more, the rise of powerful open-source AI models has accelerated the deployment of AI to solve tough business and societal challenges. Although there could be concentration risk in the hardware and cloud infrastructure space, as we move into actual use cases, a thousand flowers will bloom. the corporation, both structured and unstructured, explicit and tacit, in a way that it is consumable by AI. The quality of output needs to be managed to ensure correct and factual responses and insights with no hallucinations.\",\n",

As various nations come up with different ways of regulating AI, global companies will have to build their AI applications in a way that they are compliant in every country. While application can be trialled on very large models, deployment will be on narrow transformers, trained on relevant enterprise data, fully secure and efficient in their inferencing. Enterprises will need both an AI foundry for experimentation and an AI factory for scaling up. AI architecture must facilitate an approach that combines the analytical thinking of the left brain with the intuitive approach of the right brain. The constraint of resources will require a transparent way of identifying the highest value AI use cases. AI must amplify the potential of every human being in the enterprise. It is more than evident that enterprise AI will be markedly different from consumer AI. The manifestations of consumer AI will be packaged in wondrous ways to make life easier and more productive for millions of people. New ways of conducting search; agents that help plan work and leisure; intuitive interfaces that can serve up what's needed and reason with users; even speech recognition that understands the nuances of dialects and colloquialisms. Not unlike the smartphone that brought the magic of apps and touchscreen to billions, consumer AI will push the envelope of usability, convenience, and accessibility for everyone. Enterprise AI, on the other hand, requires a root and branch surgery of the complex and multigeneration technology (both legacy and modern), that lie within firms. The AI models themselves will become commodities. The challenge will be to orchestrate the extensive data inside\\n\\nFirms in the business of enabling digital transformation, like Infosys, will be in the eye of the storm. Software development will be rapidly automated and amplified. We have to seize the productivity benefits and share them with our customers. The productivity gains from automation, must lead to talent redeployment in new areas with new opportunities. We must learn from applying AI to ourselves, be it in creating an AI-first enterprise or in accelerating the massive talent amplification that's now needed. We are already doing it, at Infosys, by applying Infosys Topaz to transform all the services we offer to become AI-first and to accelerate business value using generative AI technologies.\",\n",

Nilekani\\n\\nChairman\\n\\n## Performance overview\\n\\n## Letter to the Shareholder\\n\\nDear shareholder,\\n\\nInfosys is the leading company in AI and generative AI\\u00a0today. We are working on several projects with clients to help them benefit from generative AI. These projects are in software engineering, process optimization, customer support, advisory services, as well as sales and marketing. They are helping our clients reduce cost, improve service quality, connect with their customers and drive growth. We are working with market-leading open access and closed large language models. Our work in AI and generative AI is available to our clients using Infosys Topaz. Enterprise AI is built using the data within enterprises. Here, our approach of narrow transformers, working deeply with enterprise data, brings significant benefit to our\\u00a0clients. In addition, we have augmented our services with generative AI and developed playbooks for each of our offerings. We are among the first IT services companies globally to achieve ISO 42001:2023 certification, which is a testament to our commitment to excellence in AI management. We were ranked as a leader in AI services by seven out of eight leading analysts. Infosys Cobalt capabilities for the cloud continue to resonate with our clients. We work closely with the major public cloud providers and on private cloud programs for our clients. Cloud, along with data, is the foundation for AI and generative AI. Data within enterprises, from their customer experiences, from their employee and supplier interactions, becomes critical foundation for successful generative AI deployment. Our strength in data, as a result of our digital leadership, is helping ensure our clients are ready to leverage the opportunity presented by generative AI. During the year, our relentless focus on execution enabled us to deliver growth and operating margin resilience. We generated US$2.9 billion of free cash flow.\",\n",

Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditure as per the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows prepared under IFRS. Dividend and buyback include applicable taxes. During the year ended March 31, 2024, the Company paid an interim dividend of \\u20b918 per share and announced a final dividend of \\u20b920 per share and special dividend of \\u20b98 per share, subject to shareholders' approval in the ensuing Annual General Meeting (AGM). Including the final and special dividend declared above, the Company has returned approximately ` 88,400\\u00a0crore, which is 85% of the cumulative free cash flow for fiscals 2020-2024 through dividends and buybacks, in line with the Capital Allocation Policy. The Capital Allocation Policy is available on our website, at https://www.infosys.com/investors/corporate-governance/ documents/capital-allocation-policy.pdf. ## Liquidity\\n\\nOur principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, investments and the cash flow that we generate from our operations. We continue to be debt-free and maintain sufficient cash to meet our strategic and operational requirements. We understand that liquidity in the Balance Sheet has to balance between earning adequate returns and the need to cover financial and business requirements. Liquidity enables us to be agile and ready for meeting unforeseen strategic and business needs and opportunities. As of March 31, 2024, we had \\u20b943,866 crore in working capital on a standalone basis, and \\u20b950,638 crore on a consolidated basis. Consolidated cash and investments stand at \\u20b930,579 crore on a standalone basis and \\u20b939,005 crore on a consolidated basis as on March 31, 2024, as against \\u20b922,509 crore on a standalone basis, and \\u20b931,286 crore on a consolidated basis as on March 31, 2023. Consolidated cash and investments, on both standalone and consolidated basis, include deposits with banks with high credit ratings by international and domestic credit rating agencies. As a result, liquidity risk of cash and cash equivalents is limited. Ratings are monitored periodically. Liquid assets also include investments in liquid mutual fund units, target maturity funds units, certificates of deposit (CDs), commercial paper (CP), quoted bonds and securities issued by government and quasigovernment organizations, and non-convertible debentures.\",\n",

For fiscal 2024, the Company has engaged an external agency to provide support and assistance for an independent review and impact assessment. ## Methodology:\\n\\nIn order to assess the impact of its CSR projects, a mixed-method approach was deployed which involved either one of or both the quantitative and qualitative research tools (as relevant) for primary data collection. Using these tools, the team conducted interactions (virtual and on-field) with the project beneficiaries and other relevant stakeholders. Post data collection and analysis, the key insights and findings were collated in the form of a consolidated report for the Management's consideration. This study was guided by the Inclusiveness, Relevance, Effectiveness, Convergence and Sustainability (IRECS) Framework which was used to provide overall feedback on the efficacy of implementation as well, as its efficiency in terms of achievement of the desired project outputs with reference to inputs.\",\n",

Energy: Infosys follows a two-pronged strategy of constructing super-efficient new buildings and improving operations in existing buildings. Every new building at Infosys strives to set a benchmark for energy efficiency, thereby redefining industry best standards and practices. Smart automation continues to play an important role in remote operations to ensure longterm efficiency, continuously identifying opportunities for improvement and increasing system resilience. While new buildings were built to high energy efficiency standards from the outset, the capital investment in energy conservation projects in existing buildings amounted to ` 3.4\\u00a0crore in fiscal 2024. Infosys Crescent campus in Bengaluru was recognized as one of the 100 iconic sustainable buildings across G-20 member countries and beyond. Various government organizations and corporates visited our campuses to witness innovative energy and water conservation techniques. Solar Decathlon India, the world's largest net-zero building challenge, held at our campus in Mysuru, is a testament to our advocacy efforts to positive global climate action beyond our boundaries. Renewable energy: With a total installed capacity of about 60.2\\u00a0MW of solar PV, including roof-top and ground-mounted systems, we continue to pursue our ambition to transition to renewables for our operations. In addition to our own solar plants, we procure green power from third-party power producers and from DISCOMs through green tariff mechanism. In fiscal 2024, 67.52% of our electricity in India operations was met through renewables. Transformed workplace: Infosys workplace transformation strategy is inspired by new principles that are aligned to the hybrid operating model. The office spaces at all locations are being upgraded as per the new strategy. The new workplaces are designed to be productive within the hybrid operating model, promote the social capital of the organization, are flexible, equipped with technology for digital collaboration, provide health and wellness and are also environmentally sustainable in line with our ESG goals and vision. The workplace transformation strategy has been implemented across multiple locations at Infosys. Water management: Water conservation has been one of our focus areas and this has been enabled through a holistic approach to water management. The state-of-the-art sewage treatment plants with tertiary treatment capabilities enable zero discharge of wastewater from our campuses. We have implemented lake rejuvenation projects near our campuses, that will enhance water availability in the surroundings.\",\n",

Waste management: Infosys follows the principles of Circular economy, based on Refuse, Reduce, Reuse, Recycle and Repurpose approach. We seek to uphold our ambition of 'zero waste to landfill' through active minimization combined with technological investments in recycling and streamlining systems and processes. We have achieved TRUE certification for zero waste, aimed at diversion of all non-hazardous solid waste from landfill at three of our campuses in India during the year. We have focused on diverting a portion of identified waste going for incineration to co-processing. Carbon offset: Unavoidable emissions are addressed through the carbon offset program. Infosys continues to identify projects that have a high social impact - improving the health and livelihoods of rural families and creating employment opportunities, and along the way, also generating carbon offsets for the Company. Our unique offset program is certified to the highest level (Gold Standard) in terms of quality, authenticity and transparency. This year, we have implemented an improved cookstove project in Rajasthan and a biogas projects in Maharashtra and Karnataka. The improved cookstove reduces smoke and firewood usage, and thus has a positive impact on health.

Infosys is certified to ISO 14001:2015 (Environmental Management System) and ISO 45001:2018 (Occupational Health &amp; Safety Management System) in line with our strategy. The\\u00a0HSEMS takes cognizance of interested parties and focuses on compliance with applicable laws in the regions where we operate. It includes well-defined policies and procedures and also strives to keep interested parties well-informed, trained and committed to our HSE process. ## Technology absorption\\n\\nLive Enterprise@Infosys: An enterprise that senses, feels and responds in real-time - this was the theme of our transformation journey in the recent years. It had to be a mobile-first approach so that employees are connected to the organization wherever they are in the world and can access the organization's resources to learn and contribute. The response has been phenomenal as over 5,50,000 users have tried the InfyMe mobile app with its 300+ features since its launch and more than 73,000 users have rated it 4.6/5 on Google PlayStore. With process bursting, we have seen many of our key processes become faster and more responsive and the Live Enterprise platform itself has been built on the latest open source stack. Following the overwhelming success in Infosys, we are also seeing interest of the Orbit platform (InfyMe version for our clients) as 13 clients have already been onboarded and many more are in discussion. To enable this, our core backend infrastructure was transformed to host modern applications, using the scalability of the cloud, security of on-premise infrastructure in a hybrid cloud deployment with open source technologies and highly scalable container orchestration solutions like Kubernetes for microservices. The telemetry infrastructure using the ELK stack provides enhanced real-time visibility and enables proactive error detection and correction.\",\n",

Modern, hybrid, and secure workplace: Our hybrid workplace ecosystem brings together technologies such as borderless ODCs, virtual collaboration tools, and self-service applications to provide our employees the flexibility to work effectively in a hybrid environment. Our robust IT management system minimizes threats and prevents attacks, through a continuous cycle of vulnerability assessments and remediations to protect our data. Multiple collaboration tools enable our employees to connect, collaborate and innovate anytime, anywhere, resulting in a culture of collaboration and innovation. Cloud-native application platform: As part of the modernization of applications, some applications need to be exposed to different user groups with different authentication mechanisms. The cloud-native application platform offers these possibilities in a ready-to-use architecture. This enables quick onboarding of applications with industry-standard security as well as greater scalability and availability using the power of the cloud. ## Energy-efficient IT infrastructure\\n\\nWe have adopted a multi-pronged strategy to make our computer workload energy-efficient and environment-friendly. Some of the measures implemented are:\\n\\nPublic cloud adoption: Majority of internal IT applications have been moved to public cloud infrastructure. Each of our employees has access to the cloud-based platform for collaboration such as messaging, presence, video and other requirements. Additionally, they also have cloud-based unified internet access and secure private access. Data center modernization: A strategic initiative launched by InfosysIT to modernize and future-proof the data center's IT landscape continues to yield high rewards. Density-optimized hyperscale platforms have been deployed to enable high-density server virtualization and consolidation across the enterprise. Hyperscale platforms are open source-driven infrastructure innovations that enable agility at cloud scale as well as efficient pooling and utilization of resources. This initiative is delivering significant energy savings and reduces the total cost of ownership for the organization. InfosysIT has invested in Data Center Infrastructure Management (DCIM) tool to gain an accurate overview of the entire IT and facility stack of the data center, which is the foundation for optimization initiatives. Enterprise storage: We provide around 1.8PB of storage capacity for employees, delivery units and internal requirements on all flash storage with fabric pool and storage grid technology. Data is marked hot and cold based on policy. Cold data is automatically moved to cheaper storage with larger capacity, resulting in data tiering and savings in terms of data center space, power consumption and cooling.\",\n",

There are numerous risks and challenges affecting our business. These are discussed in the Risk management report section of the Integrated Annual Report. ## I. Industry structure and developments\\n\\nFiscal 2024 saw the impact of policy tightening and a reduction in inflation in most of the markets we operate in. Global GDP is estimated to have grown at 3.2% in CY 2023, compared to 3.5% in CY 2022 (1) . Worldwide IT spending on software and IT services was ~US$2.3 trillion (2) in CY2023 while IT services saw an estimated total spending of US$1.4 trillion. We expect the client spending and investments to move towards Artificial Intelligence (AI) and generative AI (gen AI) in the near term. These investments are expected to be crucial during this period of economic uncertainty. There is a new wave of dynamism in technologies. The industry is feeling the pressure to build AI strategies and stay ahead. We saw generative AI starting to reshape the industry in fiscal 2024. We continued to witness businesses attempting to reimagine their cost structures, increase business resilience and agility, personalize experiences for customers and employees, and launch new and disruptive products and services, aided by generative AI. With our leadership position in AI, we believe we are well-positioned to take advantage of these market opportunities.

Opportunities and threats\\n\\n## Our strategy\\n\\nOur clients and prospective clients are faced with transformative business opportunities due to advances in software and computing technology. These organizations are dealing with the challenge of having to reinvent their processes and systems rapidly in the AI era. This needs an understanding of new technologies and new ways of working, and also appreciation of AI landscapes, business processes and practices. Our strategy is to be a navigator for our clients as they ideate, plan and execute on their journey to an AI future.\",\n",

We have no outstanding borrowings. We believe our working capital is sufficient for our requirements. Our growth has been financed largely through cash generated from operations. Our cash flows are robust. Our operating cash flows have increased in fiscal 2024 as compared to fiscal 2023 mainly on account of increase in net profit adjusted for non-cash items partially offset by higher income tax payments. Consolidated cash and investments of \\u20b939,005 crore comprise cash and cash equivalents, current and noncurrent investments excluding investments in equity and preference shares and others. ## Capital Allocation Policy\\n\\nRefer to the Board's report in this Integrated Annual Report for details on our Capital Allocation Policy reviewed and approved on April 18, 2024. ## 7.

Outlook, risks and concerns\\n\\nWe have adopted an integrated ERM framework that is implemented across the organization by the risk management office. Our ERM framework is developed by incorporating the best practices based on COSO and ISO 31000 and then tailored to suit our unique business requirements. We have provided the details of Infosys ERM framework, key and emerging risks along with mitigation in the risk management report section of this integrated annual report. The list of risk factors which we track for our business are covered in our 20-F filing available at https://www.infosys.com/investors/reportsfilings/annual-report/annual-reports.html. ## VI. Internal Financial Control Systems and their adequacy\\n\\nInfosys has aligned its current systems of internal financial control with the requirement of Companies Act, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Internal Control Integrated Framework (the 2013 framework) is intended to increase transparency and accountability in an organization's process of designing and implementing a system of internal control. The framework requires a company to identify and analyze risks and manage appropriate responses.\",\n",

Our Company has been a leader in adopting internationally-recognized corporate governance guidelines and has set the highest standards in abiding by them. Our governance rests on our core value system of C-LIFE (Client Value, Leadership by Example, Integrity and transparency, Fairness and Excellence) and is guided by the OECD (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development) principles. Our corporate governance framework thus encompasses:\\n\\nInfosys corporate governance framework\\n\\nOur corporate governance is reinforced through the Company's Code of Conduct and Ethics, corporate governance guidelines and committee charters.

The enhancement of these corporate governance standards, through periodic evaluation and change, is one of the most important aspects of ensuring value creation for our stakeholders. Our corporate governance follows the guidelines established by the Board of the Company. These guidelines provide a structure within which directors and the Management can effectively pursue the Company's objectives for the benefit of its stakeholders. These are framed in conjunction with the Company's Memorandum &amp; Articles of Association, the charters of the committees of the Board and applicable laws / regulations / guidelines in force in India, the US and other jurisdictions, as applicable. The guidelines can be accessed on our website, at https://www.infosys.com/investors/corporate-governance/ Documents/corporate-governance-guidelines.pdf. ## Role of the Board of Directors\\n\\nThe primary role of the Board is that of trusteeship - to protect and enhance shareholder value.

Additional meetings are held when necessary. Independent directors are expected to attend at least four quarterly Board meetings and the Annual General Meeting (AGM). However, with the Board being represented by independent directors from various parts of the world, it may not be possible for all of them to be physically present at all meetings. Hence, we provide video / teleconferencing facilities to enable their participation. The Board members are expected to rigorously prepare for, attend and participate in Board and applicable committee meetings. Each member is expected to ensure their other commitments do not materially interfere with their responsibilities towards the Company. ## Meeting of independent directors\\n\\nFor the Board to exercise free and fair judgment in all matters related to the functioning of the Company as well as the Board, it is important for the independent directors to have meetings without the presence of the executive management. Schedule IV of the Companies Act, 2013 and the Rules thereunder mandate that the independent directors of the Company shall hold at least one meeting in a financial year, without the attendance of non-independent directors and members of the Management. Even before the Companies Act, 2013 came into effect, our Board's process mandated periodic meetings attended exclusively by the independent directors. During the year, the independent directors met four times. At such meetings, the independent directors discuss, among other matters, the performance of the Company and risks faced by it, the flow of information to the Board, competition, strategy, leadership strengths and weaknesses, governance, compliance, Board movements, succession planning, human resources matters and the performance of the executive members of the Board, and the Chairman. ## Responsible leadership\\n\\n## Leading by example is a key tenet of corporate governance at Infosys.

The Board works with the Nomination and Remuneration Committee to lay down the evaluation criteria for the performance of the Chairman, the Board, Board committees, and executive / non-executive / independent directors through peer evaluation, excluding the director being evaluated. Independent directors have three key roles - governance, control and guidance. Some performance indicators, based on which the independent directors are evaluated, include:\\n\\n- \\u00b7 The ability to contribute to and monitor our corporate governance practices\\n- \\u00b7 The ability to contribute by introducing international best practices to address business challenges and risks\\n- \\u00b7 Active participation in long-term strategic planning\\n- \\u00b7 Commitment to the fulfilment of a director's obligations and fiduciary responsibilities; these include participation in Board and committee meetings. To improve the effectiveness of the Board and its committees, as well as that of each individual director, a formal and rigorous Board review is internally undertaken on an annual basis. The Board had engaged Egon Zehnder, a leadership advisory firm on board matters, to conduct the Board evaluation for fiscal 2024. The evaluation process focused on Board dynamics, softer aspects, committee effectiveness and information flow to the Board or its committees, among other matters. The methodology included various techniques such as questionnaires, one-onone discussions, etc. The recommendations were discussed with the Board and individual feedback was provided. Progress on recommendations from last year and the current year's recommendations were discussed. The aspects of succession planning and committee composition were also considered. The Board evaluation process was completed during fiscal 2024. Further, the evaluation process was based on the affirmation received from the independent directors that they met the independence criteria as required under the Companies Act 2013, the Listing Regulations and the NYSE listing manual. ## Executive leadership compensation\\n\\nOur executive compensation programs encourage reward for performance. A significant portion of the executives' total rewards is tied to the delivery of long-term corporate performance goals to align with the interests of the shareholders. As required under the Listing Regulations, the Nomination and Remuneration Committee recommends to the Board the payment of remuneration to the senior management. The Nomination and Remuneration Policy of the Company is available on our website, at https://www.infosys.com/investors/corporategovernance/documents/nomination-remuneration-policy.pdf.\",\n",

The Board reviews the performance of independent directors on an annual basis. The Board, while deciding the basis for determining the compensation of the independent directors, takes various things into consideration. These include global board compensation benchmarking, participation of individual directors in Board and committee meetings, other responsibilities, such as membership or chairmanship of committees, time spent in carrying out other duties, roles and functions as prescribed in Schedule IV of the Act, Listing Regulations and such other factors as the Board deems fit. Shareholders at the 34 th AGM held on June 22, 2015 approved a sum not exceeding 1% of the net profit of the Company per annum, calculated in accordance with the provisions of Section 198 of the Companies Act, 2013, to be paid and distributed among some or all of the non-executive directors of the\\n\\n## Corporate governance report\\n\\nCompany in a manner decided by the Board.

In 1983, the corporate headquarters were relocated to Bengaluru. The name of the Company was changed to Infosys Technologies Private Limited in April 1992 and to Infosys Technologies Limited in June 1992, when the Company became a public limited company. We made an Initial Public Offering (IPO) in February 1993 and were listed on stock exchanges in India in June 1993. Trading opened at \\u20b9145 per share, compared to the IPO price of \\u20b995 per share. In October 1994, we made a private placement of 5,50,000 shares at \\u20b9450 each to Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs), Financial Institutions (FIs) and body corporates. The share data mentioned before is unadjusted for stock split and bonus shares. In July 2003, June 2005 and November 2006, we issued secondary-sponsored American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) of US$294 million, US$1.1 billion and US$1.6 billion, respectively. On March 11, 2024, Infosys marked 25 years of listing in the US. During fiscal 2012, the name of the Company was changed from Infosys Technologies Limited to Infosys Limited to mark the transition from being a technology services provider to a business transformation partner to our clients. On March 11, 1999, Infosys listed on NASDAQ, becoming the first Indian company to do so. We issued 20,70,000 American Depositary Shares (ADSs) (equivalent to 10,35,000 equity shares of par value \\u20b910 each) at US$34 per ADS under the ADS Program, and these ADSs were listed on the NASDAQ National Market. During fiscal 2013, we delisted our ADSs from NASDAQ, and listed them in the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), Euronext London and Euronext Paris. During fiscal 2019, the Company voluntarily delisted from Euronext London and Paris due to low trading volume. Infosys equity shares and ADSs are listed on NSE and BSE in India and in NYSE, respectively, under the symbol 'INFY'. Indian IT services sector is credited as having put India on the global map over two decades ago, with Infosys widely seen as being the 'posterchild' of the sector.\",\n",

The discussion may contain statements that are forward-looking in nature. Our business is subject to uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected in the forward-looking statements. If any of the risks materializes, our business, financial conditions or prospects could be materially and adversely affected. Our business, operating results, financial performance, or prospects could also be harmed by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material. Readers are advised to refer to the detailed discussion of risk factors and related disclosures in our regulatory filings and exercise their own judgment in assessing risks associated with the Company. Our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) function enables the achievement of the Company's strategic objectives by identifying, analyzing, assessing, mitigating, monitoring and governing any risk or potential threat to these objectives.

Strategic decisions are taken after careful consideration of primary risks, secondary risks, consequential risks and residual risks. The ERM function also enables effective resource allocation through structured qualitative and quantitative risk impact assessment and prioritization based on our risk appetite. Our ERM framework also enables the identification of underlying opportunities during risk assessment, which are then further evaluated and actionized by the business. Our ERM framework encompasses all of the Company's risks - strategy and strategy execution; operational; and legal and compliance risks. Any of these categories can have internal or external dimensions. Hence, appropriate risk indicators are used to identify these risks proactively. We take cognizance of risks faced by our key stakeholders and their cumulative impact while framing our risk responses. Emerging risks: Our ERM framework has defined a process to identify, assess, plan, and monitor risks emerging from internal and external environments, which enable the Company to build and maintain resilience in uncertain times. The process includes horizon scanning, and SWOT analysis, which cover political, economic, social, technology, legal and environmental aspects. The emerging risks are monitored constantly and discussed in the risk councils and with the Risk Management Committee (RMC) of the Board on periodic basis. | Strategy and strategy execution   | The risks arising out of the choices we have made in defining our strategy and the risks to the successful execution of our strategy are covered in this category.

Internal and external risk and performance indicators, and loss incidents are used in real time to identify, analyze and assess potential issues that could negatively impact strategic goals. ## RISC360 : iGRC\\n\\nRISC360 is the Company's Governance, Risk management and Compliance (GRC) program that combines three lines of defense under one umbrella. This enables risk-based decision-making and auditing. The Company has implemented a technology platform, iGRC, to provide a consolidated view of risks to strategic goals.

Health and safety management system:\\n\\n## 10a. Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the entity? (Yes / No). If yes, the coverage of such system? Yes. Infosys recognizes and accords highest priority to safety and well-being of its employees and other relevant parties. Our HSE Policy enunciates our philosophy and commitment towards the management of key HSE aspects. In line with our strategy, our HSEMS at all Indian locations is certified to ISO 45001:2018 standard. At overseas locations, we have implemented processes based on legal requirements / internal benchmarks and have also included them in the internal audits cycle. We have established numerous interventions to address occupational health-related topics such as emotional well-being, mental health, ergonomics, safety, lifestyle diseases and more. Well-equipped occupational health centers are available at all our campuses in India. During the year, doctors and physiotherapists have helped employees and their families through virtual consultations leveraging our telemedicine portal. More details on Occupational Health and Safety are available on our website at https://www.infosys.com/about/corporate-responsibility/social/employee-wellbeing/occupational-health-safety.html. ## 10b. What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis by the entity? We proactively identify occupational health and safety risks, for all existing / new / modified activities, processes, products or services, and regulatory changes, including routine and non-routine activities. Risk assessment includes quarterly evaluation of incidents that have occurred. Hazardous conditions, if any, are identified and prioritized for elimination and control. Once the identified hierarchy of controls is implemented, the risk assessment is revisited to assess the residual risks.\",\n",

Mechanism to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment cases\\n\\nInfosys' non-retaliation policy is an embodiment of our values and a cornerstone of our Code. Infosys commits to protect the complainant and ensures that they are not retaliated against because of any report that they raise in good faith. Infosys does not tolerate any form of retaliation (whether by a manager, co-worker or otherwise) against an individual because he or she made a good faith report of an integrity concern. This protection also extends to anyone who assists with or cooperates in an investigation or reports of an integrity concern or question. We support those who support our values. ## 9.

(2) Scope 2 includes India and overseas locations. ## 8. Does the entity have any project related to reducing greenhouse gas emission? If yes, provide details. Infosys has been carbon neutral since fiscal 2020 across Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. Our approach to carbon neutrality is based on reducing and avoiding emissions through energy efficiency and renewable energy. Energy efficiency is achieved through super-efficient new buildings, industry-leading Energy Performance Index (EPI) &lt;70 kWh/m2-yr, real-time monitoring and optimization of building operations through smart building systems, and retrofits in existing buildings. Infosys has implemented several retrofit projects (across air conditioning, lighting, and UPS systems) in the past and achieved a connected electrical load reduction of 36 MW across campuses in India. In fiscal 2024, we have undertaken a retrofit project to replace direct FCU units with chilled water units of air conditioning, which saved 1.1 lakh kWh and reduced emissions by 80.84 tCO2e. To achieve our goal of transitioning to clean energy, we have installed 60.2 MWp of solar PV capacity. ## 9.\",\n",

Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes. The 5R principle -' Reduce, Reuse, Refurbish, Repurpose and Recycle' - forms the foundation of Infosys' waste management strategy. Through our efforts, we turn waste into resources and thus support a circular economy. Infosys has adopted a comprehensive waste management policy that emphasizes the collection, sorting and disposal of waste. Waste management practices at Infosys include source segregation, secondary segregation, effective waste processing and collection, recycling and efficient disposal of all waste in accordance with relevant laws. This helps reduce negative impacts on the environment. We seek to uphold our ambition of 'zero waste to landfill' through active minimization combined with technology investment in recycling and streamlining systems and processes. This year, we achieved TRUE Zero Waste Certification for our owned campuses in Bengaluru, Chennai Mcity and Pune Phase-2 through Green Business Certification Inc. (GBCI). The e-waste is always sent back to original manufacturers (under buyback schemes) or authorized recyclers who provide us certificates on the successful recycling and recovery of the material. Other hazardous waste like biomedical waste, oil-soaked cotton, oil filters from DG sets, and other trash are designated by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and the State Pollution Control Board (SPCB). These agencies incinerate the waste in compliance with rules and regulations. The resulting ash is diverted for use in the production of cement in a few places and delivered to Treatment, Storage, Disposal Facility (TSDF) landfills for safe disposal. - 11.\",\n",

Does the entity have a business continuity and disaster management plan? Give details in 100 words/ web link. Infosys has a Business Continuity Management System (BCMS) called Phoenix, certified by ISO 22301:2019 Security and Resilience - Business Continuity Management Standard. This program is designed to ensure seamless continuity of business and the utmost safety of employees and organization assets while continuously meeting client expectations. The BCMS program provides a robust framework for planning, establishing, implementing, operating, monitoring, reviewing, maintaining, and continually improving business continuity measures across Infosys and its subsidiaries as per the global BCMS strategy. Infosys has a business continuity and disaster recovery plan called the Phoenix plan at the corporate level, and comprehensive business continuity plans are created at three operational levels covering business functions, locations, and accounts. Integrated into our Enterprise Risk Management Framework, the BCMS plans guide our typical response to events, such as catastrophes and natural or human-made disasters, which could disrupt or severely constrain our operations. This covers various crisis scenarios as part of detailed risk assessments for functions, locations, and accounts, which are documented with mitigation plans along with controls put in place. The management system has been continuously validated across levels through tests and exercises, and various incidents have been successfully tackled without any significant business continuity or employee safety impacts. An efficient business continuity management policy has enabled us to maintain the status quo during\\u00a0disasters. 6.

The Company assesses the services promised in a contract and identifies distinct performance obligations in the contract. Identification of distinct performance obligations to determine the deliverables and the ability of the customer to benefit independently from such deliverables involves significant judgment. |\\n|           | In certain integrated services arrangements, contracts with customers include subcontractor services or third-party vendor equipment or software. In these types of arrangements, revenue from sales of third-party vendor products or services is recorded net of costs when the Company is acting as an agent between the customer and the vendor, and gross when the Company is the principal for the transaction. In doing so, the Company first evaluates whether it obtains control of the specified goods or service before it is transferred to the customer. The Company considers whether it is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified goods or service, inventory risk, pricing discretion and other factors to determine whether it controls the products or service and therefore, is acting as a principal or an agent. |\\n|           | Fixed-price maintenance revenue is recognized ratably either on (1) a straight-line basis when services are performed through an indefinite number of repetitive acts over a specified period or (2) using a percentage-of-completion method when the pattern of benefits from the services rendered to the customer and the Company's costs to fulfil the contract is not even through the period of contract because the services are generally discrete in nature and not repetitive. The use of method to recognize the maintenance revenues requires judgment and is based on the promises in the contract and nature of the deliverables. |\\n|           | As certain contracts with customers involve management's judgment in (1) identifying distinct performance obligations, (2) determining whether the Company is acting as a principal or an agent and (3) whether fixed-price maintenance revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis or using the percentage-of-completion method, revenue recognition from these judgments were identified as a key audit matter and required a higher extent of audit effort. |\\n|           | Refer to Notes 1.4 and 2.18 to the Standalone Financial Statements.\",\n",

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Company's internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements. ## Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements\\n\\nA Company's internal financial control with reference to Standalone Financial Statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A Company's internal financial control with reference to Standalone Financial Statements includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the Company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. ## Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements\\n\\nBecause of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements to future periods are subject to the risk\\n\\n## Standalone Financial Statements\\n\\nthat the internal financial control with reference to Standalone Financial Statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\",\n",

The material accounting policy information used in preparation of the audited Standalone financial statements have been discussed in the respective notes. As the year to date figures are taken from the source and rounded to the nearest digits, the figures reported for the previous quarters might not always add up to the year to date figures reported in this statement. ## 1.3 Use of estimates and judgments\\n\\nThe preparation of the financial statements in conformity with Ind AS requires the Management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions. These estimates, judgments and assumptions affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. The application of accounting policies that require critical accounting estimates involving complex and subjective judgments and the use of assumptions in these financial statements have been disclosed in Note no. 1.4. Accounting estimates could change from period to period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Appropriate changes in estimates are made as management becomes aware of changes in circumstances surrounding the estimates. Changes in estimates and judgments are reflected in the financial statements in the period in which changes are made and, if material, their effects are disclosed in the notes to the Standalone financial statements . ## 1.4 Critical accounting estimates and judgments\\n\\n## a. Revenue recognition\\n\\nThe Company's contracts with customers include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Revenues from customer contracts are considered for recognition and measurement when the contract has been approved, in writing, by the parties to the contract, the parties to contract are committed to perform their respective obligations under the contract, and the contract is legally enforceable. The Company assesses the services promised in a contract and identifies distinct performance obligations in the contract. Identification of distinct performance obligations to determine the deliverables and the ability of the customer to benefit independently from such deliverables, and allocation of transaction price to these distinct performance obligations involves significant judgment. Fixed-price maintenance revenue is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis when services are performed through an indefinite number of repetitive acts over a specified period.\",\n",

The use of method to recognize the maintenance revenues requires judgment and is based on the promises in the contract and nature of the deliverables. The Company uses the percentage-of-completion method in accounting for other fixed-price contracts. Use of the percentage-of-completion method requires the Company to determine the actual efforts or costs expended to date as a proportion of the estimated total efforts or costs to be incurred. Efforts or costs expended have been used to measure progress towards completion as there is a direct relationship between input and productivity. The estimation of total efforts or costs involves significant judgment and is assessed throughout the period of the contract to reflect any changes based on the latest available information. Contracts with customers includes subcontractor services or third-party vendor equipment or software in certain integrated services arrangements. In these types of arrangements, revenue from sales of third-party vendor products or services is recorded net of costs when the Company is acting as an agent between the customer and the vendor, and gross when the Company is the principal for the transaction. In doing so, the Company first evaluates whether it obtains control of the specified goods\\n\\n## Standalone Financial Statements\\n\\nor services before they are transferred to the customer. The Company considers whether it is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified goods or services, inventory risk, pricing discretion and other factors to determine whether it controls the specified goods or services and therefore, is acting as a principal or an agent. Provisions for estimated losses, if any, on incomplete contracts are recorded in the period in which such losses become probable based on the estimated efforts or costs to complete the contract. ## b. Income taxes\\n\\nThe Company's two major tax jurisdictions are India and the United States, though the Company also files tax returns in other overseas jurisdictions. Significant judgments are involved in determining the provision for income taxes, including amount expected to be paid / recovered for uncertain tax positions. In assessing the realizability of deferred income tax assets, Management considers whether some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the temporary differences become deductible.\",\n",

The amount of the deferred income tax assets considered realizable, however, could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carry forward period are reduced. Refer to Note 2.17 . ## c. Property, plant and equipment\\n\\nProperty, plant and equipment represent a significant proportion of the asset base of the Company. The charge in respect of periodic depreciation is derived after determining an estimate of an asset's expected useful life and the expected residual value at the end of its life. The useful lives and residual values of Company's assets are determined by the Management at the time the asset is acquired and reviewed periodically, including at each financial year end. The lives are based on historical experience with similar assets as well as anticipation of future events, which may impact their life, such as changes in technology. Refer to Note 2.1. ## 2.

Hence, the useful lives for these assets is different from the useful lives as prescribed under Part C of Schedule II of the Companies Act 2013. Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed periodically, including at each financial year end. The useful lives are based on historical experience with similar assets as well as anticipation of future events, which may impact their life, such as changes in technology. Advances paid towards the acquisition of property, plant and equipment outstanding at each Balance Sheet date is classified as capital advances under other non-current assets and the cost of assets not ready to use before such date are disclosed under 'Capital work-in-progress'. Subsequent expenditures relating to property, plant and equipment is capitalized only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with these will flow to the Company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the financial statements upon sale or retirement of the asset. ## Impairment\\n\\nProperty, plant and equipment are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the Cash Generating Unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs.\",\n",

Intangible assets are amortized over their respective individual estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis, from the date that they are available for use. The estimated useful life of an identifiable intangible asset is based on a number of factors, including the effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, and other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, and known technological advances), and the level of maintenance expenditures required to obtain the expected future cash flows from the asset. Amortization methods and useful lives are reviewed periodically including at each financial year end. Research costs are expensed as incurred. Software product development costs are expensed as incurred unless technical and commercial feasibility of the project is demonstrated, future economic benefits are probable, the Company has an intention and ability to complete and use or sell the software and the costs can be measured reliably. The costs, which can be capitalized include the cost of material, direct labor, overhead costs that are directly attributable to prepare the asset for its intended use.\",\n",

The lease term in future periods is reassessed to ensure that the lease term reflects the current economic circumstances. ## Accounting policy\\n\\n## The Company as a lessee\\n\\nThe Company's lease asset classes primarily consist of leases for land, buildings and computers. The Company assesses whether a contract contains a lease, at inception of a contract. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Company assesses whether: (i) the contract involves the use of an identified asset (ii) the Company has substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset through the period of the lease and (iii) the Company has the right to direct the use of the asset. At the date of commencement of the lease, the Company recognizes a right-of-use asset ('ROU') and a corresponding lease liability for all lease arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for leases with a term of twelve months or less (short-term leases) and low value leases. For these short-term and low value leases, the Company recognizes the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. As a lessee, the Company determines the lease term as the noncancellable period of a lease adjusted with any option to extend or terminate the lease, if the use of such option is reasonably certain. The Company makes an assessment on the expected lease term on a lease-by-lease basis and thereby assesses whether it is reasonably certain that any options to extend or terminate the contract will be exercised. In evaluating the lease term, the Company considers factors, such as any significant leasehold improvements undertaken over the lease term, costs\\n\\nCertain lease arrangements include the options to extend or terminate the lease before the end of the lease term. ROU assets and lease liabilities include these options when it is reasonably certain that they will be exercised.\",\n",

They are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Right-of-use assets are depreciated from the commencement date on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and useful life of the underlying asset. Right-of-use assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the Cash Generating Unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs. The lease liability is initially measured at amortized cost at the present value of the future lease payments. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if not readily determinable, using the incremental borrowing rates in the country of domicile of these leases. Lease liabilities are remeasured with a corresponding adjustment to the related right of use asset if the Company changes its assessment if whether it will exercise an extension or a termination option. Lease liability and ROU asset have been separately presented in the Balance Sheet and lease payments have been classified as financing cash flows. ## The Company as a lessor\\n\\nLeases for which the Company is a lessor is classified as a finance or operating lease. Whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee, the contract is classified as a finance lease. All other leases are classified as operating leases. When the Company is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for its interests in the head lease and the sublease separately. The sublease is classified as a finance or operating lease by reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease. For operating leases, rental income is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.\",\n",

Accordingly, the same has been considered as a reduction to the total contract value and accounted as Deferred contract cost. The Company has entered into financing arrangements with a third-party for these assets. As at March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, the financial liability pertaining to such arrangements amounts to \\u20b958 crore and \\u20b9114 crore, respectively (Refer to Note 2.13) . Withholding taxes and others primarily consist of input tax credits and Cenvat / VAT recoverable from Government of India. ## 2.11 Financial instruments\\n\\nAccounting policy\\n\\n## 2.11.1 Initial recognition\\n\\nThe Company recognizes financial assets and financial liabilities when it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. All financial assets and liabilities are recognized at fair value on initial recognition, except for trade receivables which are initially measured at transaction price. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities, which are not at fair value through profit or loss, are added to the fair value on initial recognition.

Derivative financial instruments\\n\\nThe Company holds derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange forward and option contracts to mitigate the risk of changes in exchange rates on foreign currency exposures. The counterparty for such contracts is generally a bank. (i) Financial assets or financial liabilities, carried at fair value through profit or loss. This category includes derivative financial assets or liabilities which are not designated as hedges. Although the Company believes that these derivatives constitute hedges from an economic perspective, they may not qualify for hedge accounting under Ind AS 109, Financial Instruments. Any derivative that is either not designated as hedge, or is so designated but is ineffective as per Ind AS 109, is categorized as a financial asset or financial liability, at fair value through profit or loss. Derivatives not designated as hedges are recognized initially at fair value and attributable transaction costs are recognized in net profit in the Statement of Profit and Loss when incurred. Subsequent to initial recognition, these derivatives are measured at fair value through profit or loss and the resulting exchange gains or losses are included in other income. Assets / liabilities in this category are presented as current assets / current liabilities if they are either held for trading or are expected to be realized within 12 months after the Balance Sheet date. ## (ii) Cash flow hedge\\n\\nThe Company designates certain foreign exchange forward and options contracts as cash flow hedges to mitigate the risk of foreign exchange exposure on highly probable forecast cash transactions. When a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge instrument, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve. Any ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized immediately in the net profit in the Statement of Profit and Loss. If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively.\",\n",

The cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in the cash flow hedge reserve is transferred to the net profit in the Statement of Profit and Loss upon the occurrence of the related forecasted transaction. If the forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, then the amount accumulated in cash flow hedge reserve is reclassified to net profit in the Statement of Profit and Loss. ## 2.11.3 Derecognition of financial instruments\\n\\nThe Company derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or it transfers the financial asset and the transfer qualifies for derecognition under Ind AS 109. A financial liability (or a part of a financial liability) is derecognized from the Company's Balance Sheet when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged or cancelled or expires. ## 2.11.4 Fair value of financial instruments\\n\\nIn determining the fair value of its financial instruments, the Company uses a variety of methods and assumptions that are based on market conditions and risks existing at each reporting date. The methods used to determine fair value include discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing model, market multiples, available quoted market prices and dealer quotes. All methods of assessing fair value result in general approximation of value, and such value may never actually be realized. Refer to table 'Financial instruments by category' below for the disclosure on carrying value and fair value of financial assets and liabilities. For financial assets and liabilities maturing within one year from the Balance Sheet date and which are not carried at fair value, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments. ## 2.11.5 Impairment\\n\\nThe Company recognizes loss allowances using the expected credit loss (ECL) model for the financial assets and unbilled revenues which are not fair valued through profit or loss. Loss allowance for trade receivables and unbilled revenues with no significant financing component is measured at an amount equal to lifetime ECL. For all other financial assets, expected credit losses are measured at an amount equal to the 12-month ECL, unless there has been a significant increase in credit risk from initial recognition in which case those are measured at lifetime ECL. The Company determines the allowance for credit losses based on historical loss experience adjusted to reflect current and estimated future economic conditions.\",\n",

A one percentage point change in the unobservable inputs used in fair valuation of Level 3 assets and liabilities does not have a significant impact in its value. Majority of investments of the Company are fair valued based on Level 1 or Level 2 inputs. These investments primarily include investment in liquid mutual fund units, target maturity fund units, tax-free bonds, certificates of deposit, commercial papers, treasury bills, government securities, non-convertible debentures, quoted bonds issued by government and quasigovernment organizations. The Company invests after considering counterparty risks based on multiple criteria, including Tier I capital, Capital Adequacy Ratio, Credit Rating, Profitability, NPA levels and Deposit base of banks and financial institutions. These risks are monitored regularly as per Group's risk management program. ## Financial risk management\\n\\n## Financial risk factors\\n\\nThe Company's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks - market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Company's primary focus is to foresee the unpredictability of financial markets and seek to minimize potential adverse effects on its financial performance. The primary market risk to the Company is foreign exchange risk. The Company uses derivative financial instruments to mitigate foreign exchange related risk exposures. The Company's exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristic of each customer and the concentration of risk from the top few customers. ## Market risk\\n\\nThe Company operates internationally and a major portion of the business is transacted in several currencies and consequently the Company is exposed to foreign exchange risk through its sales and services in the United States and elsewhere, and purchases from overseas suppliers in various foreign currencies. The Company holds derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange forward and option contracts to mitigate the risk of changes in exchange rates on foreign currency exposures. The exchange rate between the Indian rupee and foreign currencies has changed substantially in recent years and may fluctuate substantially in the future. Consequently, the results of the Company's operations are adversely affected as the rupee appreciates / depreciates against these currencies.\",\n",

The related hedge transactions for balance in cash flow hedge reserve as at March 31, 2024 are expected to occur and reclassified to Statement of Profit and Loss within three months. The Company determines the existence of an economic relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item based on the currency, amount and timing of its forecasted cash flows. Hedge effectiveness is determined at the inception of the hedge relationship, and through periodic prospective effectiveness assessments to ensure that an economic relationship exists between the hedged item and hedging instrument, including whether the hedging instrument is expected to offset changes in cash flows of hedged items. If the hedge ratio for risk management purposes is no longer optimal but the risk management objective remains unchanged and the hedge continues to qualify for hedge accounting, the hedge relationship will be rebalanced by adjusting either the volume of the hedging instrument or the volume of the hedged item so that the hedge ratio aligns with the ratio used for risk management purposes. Any hedge ineffectiveness is calculated and accounted for in the Statement of Profit or Loss at the time of the hedge relationship rebalancing.\",\n",

The fair value of the awards are estimated using the Black-Scholes Model for time and non-market performance-based options and Monte Carlo simulation model is used for TSR-based options. The inputs to the model include the share price at date of grant, exercise price, expected volatility, expected dividends, expected term and the risk free rate of interest. Expected volatility during the expected term of the options is based on historical volatility of the observed market prices of the Company's publicly traded equity shares during a period equivalent to the expected term of the options. Expected volatility of the comparative Company have been modelled based on historical movements in the market prices of their publicly traded equity shares during a period equivalent to the expected term of the options. Correlation coefficient is calculated between each peer entity and the indices as a whole or between each entity in the peer group.\",\n",

Income tax expense is recognized in net profit in the Statement of Profit and Loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognized directly in equity, in which case it is recognized in equity or other comprehensive income. Current income tax for current and prior periods is recognized at the amount expected to be paid to or recovered from the tax authorities, using the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet date. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realized. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet date and are expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of changes in tax rates on deferred income tax assets and liabilities is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment or the substantive enactment date. A deferred income tax asset is recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and tax losses can be utilized. Deferred income taxes are not provided on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries and branches where it is expected that the earnings of the subsidiary or branch will not be distributed in the foreseeable future. The Company offsets current tax assets and current tax liabilities; deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities, where it has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognized amounts and where it intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. Tax benefits of deductions earned on exercise of employee share options in excess of compensation charged to income are credited to equity.\",\n",

These reversals pertaining to prior periods is primarily on account of adjudication of certain disputed matters, upon filing of tax return and completion of assessments, across various jurisdictions. During the year ended March 31, 2024, the Company received orders under Sections 250 and 254 of the Income-tax Act, 1961, from the Income Tax Authorities in India for the assessment years, 2007-08 to 2015-16, 2017-18 and 2018-19. These orders confirmed the Company's position with respect to tax treatment of certain contentious matters. As a result interest income (pretax) of \\u20b91,933 crore was recognized and provision for income tax aggregating \\u20b9525 crore was reversed with a corresponding credit to the Statement of Profit and Loss. Also, upon resolution of the disputes, an amount aggregating to \\u20b91,628 crore has been reduced from contingent liabilities. The foreign tax expense is due to income taxes payable overseas, principally in the United States. In India, the Company has benefited from certain income tax incentives that the Government of India had provided for export of software and services from the units registered under the Special Economic Zones Act (SEZs), 2005. SEZ units, which began the provision of services on or after April 1, 2005 are eligible for a deduction of 100% of profits or gains derived from the export of services for the first five years from the financial year in which the unit commenced the provision of services and 50% of such profits or gains for further five years. Up to 50% of such profits or gains is also available for a further five years subject to creation of a Special Economic Zone re-investment Reserve out of the profit for the eligible SEZ units and utilization of such reserve by the Company for acquiring new plant and machinery for the purpose of its business as per the provisions of the Income-tax Act, 1961. (Refer to Special Economic Zone Re-investment reserve under Note 2.12 Equity). Deferred income tax for the year ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 substantially relates to origination and reversal of temporary differences. Infosys is subject to a 15% Branch Profit Tax (BPT) in the US to the extent its US branch's net profit during the year is greater than the increase in the net assets of the US branch during the year, computed in accordance with the Internal Revenue Code.\",\n",

The Management considers the scheduled reversals of deferred income tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred income tax assets are deductible, management believes that the Company will realize the benefits of those deductible differences. The amount of the deferred income tax assets considered realizable, however, could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carry forward period are reduced. The Company's Advanced Pricing Arrangement (APA) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for US branch income tax expired in March 2021. The Company has applied for renewal of APA and currently the US taxable income is based on the Company's best estimate determined based on the expected value method. ## 2.18 Revenue from operations\\n\\n## Accounting policy\\n\\nThe Company derives revenues primarily from IT services comprising software development and related services, cloud and infrastructure services, maintenance, consulting and package implementation, licensing of software products and platforms across the Company's core and digital offerings (together called as 'software-related services'). Contracts with customers are either on a time-and-material, unit of work, fixedprice or on a fixed-timeframe basis. Revenues from customer contracts are considered for recognition and measurement when the contract has been approved in writing, by the parties, to the contract, the parties to contract are committed to perform their respective obligations under the contract, and the contract is legally enforceable. Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services ('performance obligations') to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company has received or expects to receive in exchange for these products or services ('transaction price'). When there is uncertainty as to collectability, revenue recognition is postponed until such uncertainty is resolved. The Company assesses the services promised in a contract and identifies distinct performance obligations in the contract. The Company allocates the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price. The price that is regularly charged for an item when sold separately is the best evidence of its standalone selling price. In the absence of such evidence, the primary method used to estimate standalone selling price is the expected cost plus a margin, under which the Company estimates the cost of satisfying the performance obligation and then adds an appropriate margin based on similar services.\",\n",

Revenue on time-and-material and unit of work-based contracts, are recognized as the related services are performed. Fixed-price maintenance revenue is recognized ratably either on a straight-line basis when services are performed through an indefinite number of repetitive acts over a specified period or ratably using a percentage-of-completion method when the pattern of benefits from the services rendered to the customer and Company's costs to fulfil the contract is not even through the period of contract because the services are generally discrete in nature and not repetitive. Revenue from other fixed-price, fixed-timeframe contracts, where the performance obligations are satisfied over time is recognized using the percentageof-completion method. Efforts or costs expended are used to determine progress towards completion as there is a direct relationship between input and productivity. Progress towards completion is measured as the ratio of costs or efforts incurred to date (representing work performed) to the estimated total costs or efforts. Estimates of transaction price and total costs or efforts are continuously monitored over the term of the contracts and are recognized in net profit in the period when these estimates change or when the estimates are revised. Revenues and the estimated total costs or efforts are subject to revision as the contract progresses. Provisions for estimated losses, if any, on incomplete contracts are recorded in the period in which such losses become probable based on the estimated efforts or costs to complete the contract. The billing schedules agreed with customers include periodic performance-based billing and / or milestone-based progress billings. Revenues in excess of billing are classified as unbilled revenue while billing in excess of revenues are classified as contract liabilities (which we refer to as \\\"unearned revenues\\\"). In arrangements for software development and related services and maintenance services, by applying the revenue recognition criteria for each distinct performance obligation, the arrangements with customers generally meet the criteria for considering software development and related services as distinct performance obligations. For allocating the transaction price, the Company measures the revenue in respect of each performance obligation of a contract at its relative standalone selling price.

Certain cloud and infrastructure services contracts include multiple elements which may be subject to other specific accounting guidance, such as leasing guidance. These contracts are accounted in accordance with such specific accounting guidance. In such arrangements where the Company is able to determine that hardware and services are distinct performance obligations, it allocates the consideration to these performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. In the absence of standalone selling price, the Company uses the expected cost-plus margin approach in estimating the standalone selling price. When such arrangements are considered as a single performance obligation, revenue is recognized over the period and measure of progress is determined based on promise in the contract. Revenue from licenses where the customer obtains a 'right to use' the licenses is recognized at the time the license is made available to the customer. Revenue from licenses where the customer obtains a 'right to access' is recognized over the access period. Arrangements to deliver software products generally have three elements: license, implementation and Annual Technical Services (ATS). When implementation services are provided in conjunction with the licensing arrangement and the license and implementation have been identified as two distinct separate performance obligations, the transaction price for such contracts are allocated to each performance obligation of the contract based on their relative standalone selling prices. In the absence of standalone selling price for implementation, the Company uses the expected cost plus margin approach in estimating the standalone selling price. Where the license is required to be substantially customized as part of the implementation service the entire arrangement fee for license and implementation is considered to be a single performance obligation and the revenue is recognized using the percentageof-completion method as the implementation is performed. Revenue from client training, support and other services arising due to the sale of software products is recognized as the performance obligations are satisfied. ATS revenue is recognized ratably on a straight line basis over the period in which the services are rendered. Contracts with customers includes subcontractor services or third-party vendor equipment or software in certain integrated services arrangements. In these types of arrangements, revenue from sales of third-party vendor products or services is recorded net of costs when the Company is acting as an agent between the customer and the vendor, and gross when the Company is the principal for the transaction.\",\n",

The percentage of revenue from fixed-price contracts for the year ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 is 56% and 55%, respectively. ## Trade receivables and contract balances\\n\\nThe timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections results in receivables, unbilled revenue, and unearned revenue on the Company's Balance Sheet. Amounts are billed as work progresses in accordance with agreed-upon contractual terms, either at periodic intervals (e.g., monthly or quarterly) or upon achievement of contractual milestones. The Company's receivables are rights to consideration that are unconditional. Unbilled revenues comprising revenues in excess of billings from time and material contracts and fixedprice maintenance contracts are classified as financial asset when the right to consideration is unconditional and is due only after a passage of time. Invoicing to the clients for other fixed-price contracts is based on milestones as defined in the contract and therefore the timing of revenue recognition is different from the timing of invoicing to the customers. Therefore unbilled revenues for other fixed-price contracts (contract asset) are classified as non-financial asset because the right to consideration is dependent on completion of contractual milestones. Invoicing in excess of earnings are classified as unearned revenue. Trade receivables and unbilled revenues are presented net of impairment in the Balance Sheet.\",\n",

During the year ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, \\u20b96,396 crore and \\u20b95,378 crore of unbilled revenue pertaining to other fixed-price and fixed-time frame contracts as of April 1, 2023 and April 1, 2022, respectively has been reclassified to trade receivables upon billing to customers on completion of milestones. ## Remaining performance obligation disclosure\\n\\nThe remaining performance obligation disclosure provides the aggregate amount of the transaction price yet to be recognized as at the end of the reporting period and an explanation as to when the Company expects to recognize these amounts in revenue. Applying the practical expedient as given in Ind AS 115, the Company has not disclosed the remaining performance obligation related disclosures for contracts where the revenue recognized corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the entity's performance completed to date, typically those contracts where invoicing is on time-and-material and unit of work-based contracts. Remaining performance obligation estimates are subject to change and are affected by several factors, including terminations, changes in the scope of contracts, periodic revalidations, adjustment for revenue that has not materialized and adjustments for currency fluctuations. The aggregate value of performance obligations that are completely or partially unsatisfied as at March 31, 2024, other than those meeting the exclusion criteria mentioned above, is \\u20b980,334 crore. Out of this, the Company expects to recognize revenue of around 53.7% within the next one year and the remaining thereafter. The aggregate value of performance obligations that are completely or partially unsatisfied as at March 31, 2023 was \\u20b970,680 crore. The contracts can generally be terminated by the customers and typically includes an enforceable termination penalty payable by them. Generally, customers have not terminated contracts without cause. ## 2.19 Other income, net\\n\\n## 2.19.1 Other income\\n\\n## Accounting policy\\n\\nOther income is comprised primarily of interest income, dividend income, gain / loss on investments and exchange gain / loss on forward and options contracts and on translation of foreign currency assets and liabilities. Interest income is recognized using the effective interest method. Dividend income is recognized when the right to receive payment is established. ## 2.19.2 Foreign currency\\n\\n## Accounting policy\\n\\n## Functional currency\\n\\nThe functional currency of the Company is the Indian rupee.\",\n",

The gains or losses resulting from such translations are recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss and reported within exchange gains / (losses) on translation of assets and liabilities, net, except when deferred in Other Comprehensive Income as qualifying cash flow hedges. Non-monetary assets and non-monetary liabilities denominated in a foreign currency and measured at fair value are translated at the exchange rate prevalent at the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary assets and non-monetary liabilities denominated in a foreign currency and measured at historical cost are translated at the exchange rate prevalent at the date of the transaction. The related revenue and expense are recognized using the same exchange rate. Transaction gains or losses realized upon settlement of foreign currency transactions are included in determining net profit for the period in which the transaction is settled. Revenue, expense and cash-flow items denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the relevant functional currencies using the exchange rate in effect on the date of the transaction. Other Comprehensive Income, net of taxes includes translation differences on non-monetary financial assets measured at fair value at the reporting date, such as equities classified as financial instruments and measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI). ## Government grant\\n\\nThe Company recognizes government grants only when there is reasonable assurance that the conditions attached to them shall be complied with, and the grants will be received. Government grants related to assets are treated as deferred income and are recognized in the net profit in the Statement of Profit and Loss on a systematic and rational basis over the useful life of the asset.

The Company contributes gratuity liabilities to the Infosys Limited Employees' Gratuity Fund Trust (\\\"the Trust\\\"). Trustees administer contributions made to the Trusts and contributions are invested in a scheme with the Life Insurance Corporation of India as permitted by Indian law. The Company operates defined benefit pension plan in certain overseas jurisdictions, in accordance with the local laws. These plans are managed by third-party fund managers. The plans provide for periodic payouts after retirement and / or a lumpsum payment as set out in rules of each fund and includes death and disability benefits. The defined benefit plans require contributions, which are based on a percentage of salary that varies depending on the age of the respective employees. Liabilities with regard to these defined benefit plans are determined by actuarial valuation, performed by an external actuary, at each Balance Sheet date using the projected unit credit method. These defined benefit plans expose the Company to actuarial risks, such as longevity risk, interest rate risk and market risk. The Company recognizes the net obligation of a defined benefit plan in its Balance Sheet as an asset or liability. Gains and losses through re-measurements of the net defined benefit liability / (asset) are recognized in other comprehensive income and are not reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods. The actual return of the portfolio of plan assets, in excess of the yields computed by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation is recognized in other comprehensive income. The effect of any plan amendments is recognized in net profit in the Statement of Profit and Loss. ## 2.21.2 Provident fund\\n\\nEligible employees of Infosys receive benefits from a provident fund, which is a defined benefit plan. Both the eligible employee and the Company make monthly contributions to the provident fund plan equal to a specified percentage of the covered employee's salary. The Company contributes a portion to the Infosys Limited Employees' Provident Fund Trust. The Trust invests in specific designated instruments as permitted by Indian law. The remaining portion is contributed to the government administered pension fund. The rate at which the annual interest is payable to the beneficiaries by the trust is being administered by the Government. The Company has an obligation to make good the shortfall, if any, between the return from the investments of the Trust and the notified interest rate.\",\n",

(2) The average rate of increase in compensation levels is determined by the Company, considering factors such as, the Company's past compensation revision trends, inflation in respective markets and management's estimate of future salary increases. (3) Attrition rate considered is the Management's estimate based on the past long-term trend of employee turnover in the Company. The tenure has been considered taking into account the past long-term trend of employees' average remaining service life which reflects the average estimated term of postemployment benefit obligation. For domestic defined benefit plan in India, assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set in accordance with the published statistics by the Life Insurance Corporation of India. For overseas defined benefit plan, the assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set with regard to the latest statistics in life expectancy, plan experience and other relevant data. The Company assesses all the above assumptions with its projected long-term plans of growth and prevalent industry standards. The Company contributes all ascertained liabilities towards gratuity to the Infosys Limited Employees' Gratuity Fund Trust. Trustees administer contributions made to the trust. The plan assets of the overseas defined benefit plan have been primarily invested in insurer managed funds and the asset allocation for plan assets is determined based on the investment criteria prescribed under the relevant regulations applicable to pension funds and the insurer managers. The insurers' investment are diversified and provide for guaranteed interest rates arrangements. Actual return on assets (including remeasurement) of the gratuity plan for the year ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 were \\u20b9125 crore and \\u20b9111 crore, respectively and for the pension plan were \\u20b921 crore and (\\u20b944) crore, respectively. The contributions for gratuity are invested in a scheme with the Life Insurance Corporation of India as permitted by Indian law.\",\n",

If bond yields fall, the defined benefit obligation will tend to increase. Life expectancy and investment risk: The pension fund offers the choice between a lifelong pension and a cash lump sum upon retirement. The pension fund has defined rates for converting the lump sum to a pension and there is the risk that the members live longer than implied by these conversion rates and that the pension assets don't achieve the investment return implied by these conversion rates. Asset volatility: A proportion of the pension fund is held in equities, which is expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long term but give exposure to volatility and risk in the short term. The pension fund board of insurer is responsible for the investment strategy and equity allocation is justified given the long-term investment horizon of the pension fund and the objective to provide a reasonable long term return on members' account balances.\",\n",

Diluted earnings per equity share is computed by dividing the net profit attributable to the equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of equity shares considered for deriving basic earnings per equity share and also the weighted average number of equity shares that could have been issued upon conversion of all dilutive potential equity shares. The dilutive potential equity shares are adjusted for the proceeds receivable had the equity shares been actually issued at fair value (i.e. the average market value of the outstanding equity shares). Dilutive potential equity shares are deemed converted as at the beginning of the period, unless issued at a later date. Dilutive potential equity shares are determined independently for each period presented. The number of equity shares and potentially dilutive equity shares are adjusted retrospectively for all periods presented for any share splits and bonus shares issues including for changes effected prior to the approval of the financial statements by the Board of Directors.\",\n",

The Group assesses the services promised in a contract and identifies distinct performance obligations in the contract. Identification of distinct performance obligations to determine the deliverables and the ability of the customer to benefit independently from such deliverables involves significant judgement. In certain integrated services arrangements, contracts with customers include subcontractor services or third-party vendor equipment or software. In these types of arrangements, revenue from sales of third-party vendor products or services is recorded net of costs when the Group is acting as an agent between the customer and the vendor, and gross when the Group is the principal for the transaction. In doing so, the Group first evaluates whether it obtains control of the specified goods or services before it is transferred to the customer. The Group considers whether it is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified goods or services, inventory risk, pricing discretion and other factors to determine whether it controls the products or service and therefore, is acting as a principal or an agent. Fixed price maintenance revenue is recognized ratably either on (1) a straight-line basis when services are performed an indefinite number of repetitive acts over a specified period or (2) using a percentage of completion method when the pattern of benefits from the services rendered to the customer and the Group's costs to fulfil the contract is not even the period of contract because the services are generally discrete in nature and not repetitive. The use of method to the maintenance revenues requires judgment and is based on the promises in the contract and nature of the deliverables. As certain contracts with customers involve management's judgment in (1) identifying distinct performance obligations, (2) determining whether the Group is acting as a principal or an agent and (3) whether fixed price maintenance revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis or using the percentage of completion method, revenue recognition from these judgments were identified as a key audit matter and required a higher extent of audit effort. |\\n|           | through

These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to the respective company's policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Act. ## Auditor's Responsibility\\n\\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary companies, which are companies incorporated in India, based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the 'Guidance Note') issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India ('ICAI') and the Standards on Auditing, prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements was established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects. Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary companies, which are companies incorporated in India.\",\n",

A company's internal financial control with reference to consolidated financial statements includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. ## Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements\\n\\nBecause of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control with reference to consolidated financial statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. ## Opinion\\n\\nIn our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the Company and its subsidiary companies, which are companies incorporated in India, have, in all material respects, an adequate internal financial controls system with reference to consolidated financial statements and such internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements were operating effectively as at March 31, 2024, based on the criteria for internal financial control with reference to consolidated financial statements established by the respective companies considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the ICAI.

The cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities of the Group are segregated. The Group considers all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash to be cash equivalents.\",\n",

The Ind AS are prescribed under Section 133 of the Act read with Rule 3 of the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 and relevant amendment rules issued thereafter. Accounting policies have been consistently applied except where a newly-issued accounting standard is initially adopted or a revision to an existing accounting standard requires a change in the accounting policy hitherto in use. The material accounting policy information used in preparation of the audited Consolidated financial statements have been discussed in the respective notes. As the year-end figures are taken from the source and rounded to the nearest digits, the figures reported for the previous quarters might not always add up to the year-end figures reported in this statement. ## 1.3 Basis of consolidation\\n\\nInfosys consolidates entities which it owns or controls. The Consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company, its controlled trusts and its subsidiaries. Control exists when the parent has power over the entity, is exposed, or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those\\n\\nThe financial statements of the Group companies are consolidated on a line-by-line basis and intra-group balances and transactions including unrealized gain / loss from such transactions are eliminated upon consolidation. These financial statements are prepared by applying uniform accounting policies in use at the Group. Non-controlling interests which represent part of the net profit or loss and net assets of subsidiaries that are not, directly or indirectly, owned or controlled by the Company, are excluded. Refer to Note 2.25 for the list of subsidiaries and controlled trusts of the Company. ## 1.4 Use of estimates and judgments\\n\\nThe preparation of the financial statements in conformity with Ind AS requires the Management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions. These estimates, judgments and assumptions affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. The application of accounting policies that require critical accounting estimates involving complex and subjective judgments and the use of assumptions in these financial statements have been disclosed in Note 1.5. Accounting estimates could change from period to period.\",\n",

Changes in estimates and judgments are reflected in the financial statements in the period in which changes are made and, if material, their effects are disclosed in the notes to the Consolidated financial statements. ## 1.5 Critical accounting estimates and judgments\\n\\n## a. Revenue recognition\\n\\nThe Group's contracts with customers include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Revenues from customer contracts are considered for recognition and measurement when the contract has been approved, in writing, by the parties to the contract, the parties to contract are committed to perform their respective obligations under the contract, and the contract is legally enforceable. The Group assesses the services promised in a contract and identifies distinct performance obligations in the contract. Identification of distinct performance obligations to determine the deliverables and the ability of the customer to benefit independently from such deliverables, and allocation of transaction price to these distinct performance obligations involves significant judgment. Fixed-price maintenance revenue is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis when services are performed through an indefinite number of repetitive acts over a specified period. Revenue from fixed-price maintenance contract is recognized ratably using a percentage of completion method when the pattern of benefits from the services rendered to the customer and the Group's costs to fulfil the contract is not even through the period of the contract because the services are generally discrete in nature and not repetitive. The use of method to recognize the maintenance revenues requires judgment and is based on the promises in the contract and nature of the deliverables. The Group uses the percentage-of-completion method in accounting for other fixed-price contracts. Use of the percentage-of-completion method requires the Group to determine the actual efforts or costs expended to date as a proportion of the estimated total efforts or costs to be incurred. Efforts or costs expended have been used to measure progress towards completion as there is a direct relationship between input and productivity. The estimation of total efforts or costs involves significant judgment and is assessed throughout the period of the contract to reflect any changes based on the latest available information. Contracts with customers includes subcontractor services or third-party vendor equipment or software in certain integrated services arrangements. In these types of arrangements, revenue from sales of third-party vendor products or services is recorded net of costs when the Group is acting as an agent between the customer and the vendor, and gross when the Group is the principal for the transaction.\",\n",

The Group considers whether it is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified goods or services, inventory risk, pricing discretion and other factors to determine whether it controls the specified goods or services and therefore, is acting as a principal or an agent. Provisions for estimated losses, if any, on incomplete contracts are recorded in the period in which such losses become probable based on the estimated efforts or costs to complete the contract. ## b. Income taxes\\n\\nThe Group's two major tax jurisdictions are India and the United States, though the Company also files tax returns in other overseas jurisdictions. Significant judgments are involved in determining the provision for income taxes, including amount expected to be paid / recovered for uncertain tax positions. In assessing the realizability of deferred income tax assets, the Management considers whether some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the temporary differences become deductible. The Management considers the scheduled reversals of deferred income tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred income tax assets are deductible, the Management believes that the Group will realize the benefits of those deductible differences. The amount of the deferred income tax assets considered realizable, however, could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carry forward period are reduced. Also, refer to Note 2.17. ## c. Business combinations and intangible assets\\n\\nBusiness combinations are accounted for using Ind AS 103, Business Combinations . Ind AS 103 requires us to fair value identifiable intangible assets and contingent consideration to ascertain the net fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree. These valuations are conducted by external valuation experts. Estimates are required to be made in determining the value of contingent consideration, value of option arrangements and intangible assets. These measurements are based on information available at the acquisition date and are based on expectations and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management (Refer to Note 2.1 and 2.4.2) . ## d.

Impairment of goodwill\\n\\nGoodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and whenever there is an indication that the recoverable amount of a Cash Generating Unit (CGU) is less than its carrying amount. For the impairment test, goodwill is allocated to the CGU or groups of CGUs which benefit from the synergies of the acquisition and which represent the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. The recoverable amount of CGUs is determined based on higher of value-in-use and fair value less cost to sell.

The purchase price also includes the fair value of any contingent consideration. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair value on the date of acquisition. Contingent consideration is remeasured at fair value at each reporting date and changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss. The interest of non-controlling shareholders is initially measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling interests' proportionate share of the acquiree's identifiable net assets. The choice of measurement basis is made on an acquisition-byacquisition basis. Subsequent to acquisition, the carrying amount of non-controlling interests is the amount of those interests at initial recognition plus the non-controlling interests' share of subsequent changes in equity of subsidiaries.\",\n",

When the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired exceeds purchase consideration, the fair value of net assets acquired is reassessed and the bargain purchase gain is recognized in capital reserve. Goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses. ## Impairment\\n\\nGoodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and whenever there is an indication that the recoverable amount of a Cash Generating Unit (CGU) is less than its carrying amount. For the impairment test, goodwill is allocated to the CGU or groups of CGUs which benefit from the synergies of the acquisition and which represents the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. A CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or group of assets. Impairment occurs when the carrying amount of a CGU including the goodwill, exceeds the estimated recoverable amount of the CGU. The recoverable amount of a CGU is the higher of its fair value less cost to sell and its value-in-use. Value-in-use is the present value of future cash flows expected to be derived from the CGU. Key assumptions in the cash flow projections are prepared based on current economic conditions and includes estimated long term growth rates, weighted average cost of capital and estimated operating margins.\",\n",

Reasonable sensitivities in key assumptions is unlikely to cause the carrying amount to exceed the recoverable amount of the cash generating units. ## 2.4.2 Intangible assets\\n\\n## Accounting policy\\n\\nIntangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment. Intangible assets are amortized over their respective individual estimated useful lives on a straightline basis, from the date that they are available for use. The estimated useful life of an identifiable intangible asset is based on a number of factors including the effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, and other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, and known technological advances)\\n\\nand the level of maintenance expenditures required to obtain the expected future cash flows from the asset. Amortization methods and useful lives are reviewed periodically including at each financial year end. Research costs are expensed as incurred. Software product development costs are expensed as incurred unless technical and commercial feasibility of the project is demonstrated, future economic benefits are probable, the Group has an intention and ability to complete and use or sell the software and the costs can be measured reliably. The costs which can be capitalized include the cost of material, direct labor, overhead costs that are directly attributable to prepare the asset for its intended use. ## Impairment\\n\\nIntangible assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the CGU to which the asset belongs. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss is measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the estimated recoverable amount of the asset. An impairment loss is reversed in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. The carrying amount of the asset is increased to its revised recoverable amount, provided that this amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of any accumulated amortization) had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset in prior years.\",\n",

Accordingly, the same has been considered as a reduction to the total contract value and accounted as Deferred contract cost.

All financial assets and liabilities are recognized at fair value on initial recognition, except for trade receivables which are initially measured at transaction price. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities, which are not at fair value through profit or loss, are added to the fair value on initial recognition. Regular way purchase and sale of financial assets are accounted for at trade date. ## 2.11.2 Subsequent measurement\\n\\n- a.

(ii) Financial assets carried at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)\\n\\nA financial asset is subsequently measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if it is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

Derivative financial instruments\\n\\nThe Group holds derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange forward and option contracts to mitigate the risk of changes in exchange rates on foreign currency exposures. The counterparty for such contracts is generally a bank. ## (i) Financial assets or financial liabilities, carried at fair value through profit or loss. This category includes derivative financial assets or liabilities which are not designated as hedges. Although the Group believes that these derivatives constitute hedges from an economic perspective, they may not qualify for hedge accounting under Ind AS 109, Financial Instruments . Any derivative that is either not designated as hedge, or is so designated but is ineffective as per Ind AS 109, is categorized as a financial asset or financial liability, at fair value through profit or loss. Derivatives not designated as hedges are recognized initially at fair value and attributable transaction costs are recognized in net profit in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss when incurred. Subsequent to initial recognition, these derivatives are measured at fair value through profit or loss and the resulting exchange gains or losses are included in other income. Assets / liabilities in this category are presented as current assets / current liabilities if they are either held for trading or are expected to be realized within 12 months after the Balance Sheet date. ## (ii) Cash flow hedge\\n\\nThe Group designates certain foreign exchange forward and options contracts as cash flow hedges to mitigate the risk of foreign exchange exposure on highly probable forecast cash transactions. When a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedging instrument, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the cash flow hedging reserve. Any ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized immediately in the net profit in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss. If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognized in cash flow hedging reserve till the period the hedge was effective remains in cash flow hedging reserve until the forecasted transaction occurs.\",\n",

If the forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, then the amount accumulated in cash flow hedging reserve is reclassified to net profit in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss. ## 2.11.3 Derecognition of financial instruments\\n\\nThe Group derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or it transfers the financial asset and the transfer qualifies for derecognition under Ind AS 109. A financial liability (or a part of a financial liability) is derecognized from the Group's Balance Sheet when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged or cancelled or expires. ## 2.11.4 Fair value of financial instruments\\n\\nIn determining the fair value of its financial instruments, the Group uses a variety of methods and assumptions that are based on market conditions and risks existing at each reporting date. The methods used to determine fair value include discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing model, market multiples, available quoted market prices and dealer quotes. All methods of assessing fair value result in general approximation of value, and such value may never actually be realized. Refer to table 'Financial instruments by category' below for the disclosure on carrying value and fair value of financial assets and liabilities. For financial assets and liabilities maturing within one year from the Balance Sheet date and which are not carried at fair value, the carrying amounts approximates fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments. ## 2.11.5 Impairment\\n\\nThe Group recognizes loss allowances using the expected credit loss (ECL) model for the financial assets and unbilled revenue which are not fair valued through profit or loss. Loss allowance for trade receivables and unbilled revenues with no significant financing component is measured at an amount equal to lifetime ECL. For all other financial assets, ECLs are measured at an amount equal to the 12-month ECL, unless there has been a significant increase in credit risk from initial recognition in which case those are measured at lifetime ECL. The Group determines the allowance for credit losses based on historical loss experience adjusted to reflect current and estimated future economic conditions. The Group considers current and anticipated future economic conditions relating to industries the Group deals with and the countries where it operates.\",\n",

A one percentage point change in the unobservable inputs used in fair valuation of Level 3 assets and liabilities does not have a significant impact in its value. Majority of investments of the Group are fair valued based on Level 1 or Level 2 inputs. These investments primarily include investment in liquid mutual fund units, target maturity fund units, tax-free bonds, certificates of deposit, commercial papers, treasury bills, government securities, non-convertible debentures, quoted bonds issued by government and quasi-government organizations. The Group invests after considering counterparty risks based on multiple criteria including Tier I capital, Capital Adequacy Ratio, Credit Rating, Profitability, NPA levels and Deposit base of banks and financial institutions. These risks are monitored regularly as per Group's risk management program. ## Financial risk management\\n\\n## Financial risk factors\\n\\nfocus is to foresee the unpredictability of financial markets and seek to minimize potential adverse effects on its financial performance. The primary market risk to the Group is foreign exchange risk. The Group uses derivative financial instruments to mitigate foreign exchange related risk exposures. The Group's exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristic of each customer and the concentration of risk from the top few customers. ## Market risk\\n\\nThe Group operates internationally and a major portion of the business is transacted in several currencies and consequently the Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk through its sales and services in the United States and elsewhere, and purchases from overseas suppliers in various foreign currencies. The Group holds derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange forward and option contracts to mitigate the risk of changes in exchange rates on foreign currency exposures. The Group is also exposed to foreign exchange risk arising on intercompany transaction in foreign currencies. The exchange rate between the Indian rupee and foreign currencies has changed substantially in recent years and may fluctuate substantially in the future. Consequently, the results of the Group's operations are adversely affected as the rupee appreciates / depreciates against these currencies. The Group's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.\",\n",

In accordance with Section 69 of the Companies Act, 2013, as at March 31, 2023, the Company has created a Capital Redemption Reserve of \\u20b930 crore equal to the nominal value of the shares bought back as an appropriation from general reserve and retained earnings.

The fair value of the awards are estimated using the Black-Scholes Model for time and non-market performance-based options and Monte Carlo simulation model is used for TSR-based options. The inputs to the model include the share price at date of grant, exercise price, expected volatility, expected dividends, expected term and the risk free rate of interest. Expected volatility during the expected term of the options is based on historical volatility of the observed market prices of the Company's publicly traded equity shares during a period equivalent to the expected term of the options. Expected volatility of the comparative company have been modelled based on historical movements in the market prices of their publicly traded equity shares during a period equivalent to the expected term of the options. Correlation coefficient is calculated between each peer entity and the indices as a whole or between each entity in the peer group.\",\n",

The Group estimates such costs based on historical experience and estimates are reviewed on a periodic basis for any material changes in assumptions and likelihood of occurrence. ## b.

Also, upon resolution of the disputes, an amount aggregating to \\u20b91,628 crore has been reduced from contingent liabilities.

Up to 50% of such profits or gains is also available for a further five years subject to creation of a Special Economic Zone re-Investment Reserve out of the profit of the eligible SEZ units and utilization of such reserve by the Group for acquiring new plant and machinery for the purpose of its business as per the provisions of the Income-tax Act, 1961.

The amount of the deferred income tax assets considered realizable, however, could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carry forward period are reduced. The Company's Advanced Pricing Arrangement (APA) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for US branch income tax expired in March 2021. The Company has applied for renewal of APA and currently the US taxable income is based on the Company's best estimate determined based on the expected value method. ## 2.18 Revenue from operations\\n\\n## Accounting policy\\n\\nThe Group derives revenues primarily from IT services comprising software development and related services, cloud and infrastructure services, maintenance, consulting and package implementation, licensing of software products and platforms across the Group's core and digital offerings (together called as 'software-related services') and business process management services. Contracts with customers are either on a time-andmaterial, unit of work, fixed-price or on a fixed-timeframe basis. Revenues from customer contracts are considered for recognition and measurement when the contract has been approved in writing by the parties, to the contract, the parties to contract are committed to perform their respective obligations under the contract, and the contract is legally enforceable. Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services ('performance obligations') to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Group has received or expects to receive in exchange for these products or services ('transaction price'). When there is uncertainty as to collectability, revenue recognition is postponed until such uncertainty is resolved. The Group assesses the services promised in a contract and identifies distinct performance obligations in the contract. The Group allocates the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price. The price that is regularly charged for an item when sold separately is the best evidence of its standalone selling price. In the absence of such evidence, the primary method used to estimate standalone selling price is the expected cost plus a margin, under which the Group estimates the cost of satisfying the performance obligation and then adds an appropriate margin based on similar services.\",\n",

The Group includes variable consideration as part of transaction price when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount of the variable consideration and when it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. Revenue on time-and-material and unit of work based contracts, are recognized as the related services are performed. Fixed-price maintenance revenue is recognized ratably either on a straightline basis when services are performed through an indefinite number of repetitive acts over a specified period or ratably using a percentage of completion method when the pattern of benefits from the services rendered to the customer and the Group's costs to fulfil the contract is not even through the period of contract because the services are generally discrete in nature and not repetitive. Revenue from other fixed-price, fixed-timeframe contracts, where the performance obligations are satisfied over time is recognized using the percentageof-completion method. Efforts or costs expended are used to determine progress towards completion as there is a direct relationship between input and productivity. Progress towards completion is measured as the ratio of costs or efforts incurred to date (representing work performed) to the estimated total costs or efforts. Estimates of transaction price and total costs or efforts are continuously monitored over the term of the contracts and are recognized in net profit in the period when these estimates change or when the estimates are revised. Revenues and the estimated total costs or efforts are subject to revision as the contract progresses. Provisions for estimated losses, if any, on incomplete contracts are recorded in the period in which such losses become probable based on the estimated efforts or costs to complete the contract. The billing schedules agreed with customers include periodic performance-based billing and / or milestone-based progress billings. Revenues in excess of billing are classified as unbilled revenue while billing in excess of revenues are classified as contract liabilities (which we refer to as unearned revenues). In arrangements for software development and related services and maintenance services, by applying the revenue recognition criteria for each distinct performance obligation, the arrangements with customers generally meet the criteria for considering software development and related services as distinct performance obligations. For allocating the transaction price, the Group measures the revenue in respect of each performance obligation of a contract at its relative standalone selling price.

For software development and related services, the performance obligations are satisfied as and when the services are rendered since the customer generally obtains control of the work as it progresses. Certain cloud and infrastructure services contracts include multiple elements which may be subject to other specific accounting guidance, such as leasing guidance. These contracts are accounted in accordance with such specific accounting guidance. In such arrangements where the Group is able to determine that hardware and services are distinct performance obligations, it allocates the consideration to these performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. In the absence of standalone selling price, the Group uses the expected cost-plus margin approach in estimating the standalone selling price. When such arrangements are considered as a single performance obligation, revenue is recognized over the period and measure of progress is determined based on promise in the contract. Revenue from licenses where the customer obtains a 'right to use' the licenses is recognized at the time the license are made available to the customer. Revenue from licenses where the customer obtains a 'right to access' is recognized over the access period. Arrangements to deliver software products generally have three elements: license, implementation and Annual Technical Services (ATS). When implementation services are provided in conjunction with the licensing arrangement and the license and implementation have been identified as two distinct separate performance obligations, the transaction price for such contracts are allocated to each performance obligation of the contract based on their relative standalone selling prices. In the absence of standalone selling price for implementation, the Group uses the expected cost plus margin approach in estimating the standalone selling price. Where the license is required to be substantially customized as part of the implementation service the entire arrangement fee for license and implementation is considered to be a single performance obligation and the revenue is recognized using the percentageof-completion method as the implementation is performed. Revenue from client training, support and other services arising due to the sale of software products is recognized as the performance obligations are satisfied. ATS revenue is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the period in which the services are rendered. Contracts with customers includes subcontractor services or third-party vendor equipment or software in certain integrated services arrangements. In these types of arrangements, revenue from sales of third-party vendor products or services is recorded net of costs when the Group is acting as an agent between the customer and the vendor, and gross when the Group is the principal for the transaction.\",\n",

The Group considers whether it is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified goods or services, inventory risk, pricing discretion and other factors to determine whether it controls the specified goods or services and therefore, is acting as a principal or an agent. A contract modification is a change in the scope or price or both of a contract that is approved by the parties to the contract. A contract modification that results in the addition of distinct performance obligations are accounted for either as a separate contract if the additional services are priced at the standalone selling price or as a termination of the existing contract and creation of a new contract if they are not priced at the standalone selling price. If the modification does not result in a distinct performance obligation, it is accounted for as part of the existing contract on a cumulative catch-up basis. The incremental costs of obtaining a contract (i.e., costs that would not have been incurred if the contract had not been obtained) are recognized as an asset if the Group expects to recover them. Certain eligible, non-recurring costs (e.g. set-up or transition or transformation costs) that do not represent a separate performance obligation are recognized as an asset when such costs (a) relate directly to the contract; (b) generate or enhance resources of the Group that will be used in satisfying the performance obligation in the future; and (c) are expected to be recovered. Capitalized contract costs relating to upfront payments to customers are amortized to revenue and other capitalized costs are amortized to expenses over the respective contract life on a systematic basis consistent with the transfer of goods or services to customer to which the asset relates. Capitalized costs are monitored regularly for impairment. Impairment losses are recorded when present value of projected remaining operating cash flows is not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the capitalized costs. The Group presents revenues net of indirect taxes in its Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.\",\n",

Amounts are billed as work progresses in accordance with agreed-upon contractual terms, either at periodic intervals (e.g., monthly or quarterly) or upon achievement of contractual milestones. The Group's receivables are rights to consideration that are unconditional. Unbilled revenues comprising revenues in excess of billings from time and material contracts and fixed-price maintenance contracts are classified as financial asset when the right to consideration is unconditional and is due only after a passage of time. Invoicing to the clients for other fixed-price contracts is based on milestones as defined in the contract and therefore the timing of revenue recognition is different from the timing of invoicing to the customers. Therefore, unbilled revenues for other fixed-price contracts (contract asset) are classified as non-financial asset because the right to consideration is dependent on completion of contractual milestones. Invoicing in excess of earnings are classified as unearned revenue. Trade receivables and unbilled revenues are presented net of impairment in the consolidated Balance Sheet.\",\n",

Applying the practical expedient as given in Ind AS 115, the Group has not disclosed the remaining performance obligation related disclosures for contracts where the revenue recognized corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the entity's performance completed to date, typically those contracts where invoicing is on time and material and unit of work-based contracts. Remaining performance obligation estimates are subject to change and are affected by several factors, including terminations, changes in the scope of contracts, periodic revalidations, adjustment for revenue that has not materialized and adjustments for currency fluctuations. The aggregate value of performance obligations that are completely or partially unsatisfied as at March 31, 2024, other than those meeting the exclusion criteria mentioned above, is \\u20b990,658 crore. Out of this, the Group expects to recognize revenue of around 53.0% within the next one year and the remaining thereafter. The aggregate value of performance obligations that are completely or partially unsatisfied as at March 31, 2023 was \\u20b980,867 crore. The contracts can generally be terminated by the customers and typically includes an enforceable termination penalty payable by them. Generally, customers have not terminated contracts without cause. ## 2.19 Other income, net\\n\\n## Accounting policy\\n\\nOther income is comprised primarily of interest income, dividend income, gain / loss on investment and exchange gain / loss on forward and options contracts and on translation of foreign currency assets and liabilities. Interest income is recognized using the effective interest method. Dividend income is recognized when the right to receive payment is established.\",\n",

These financial statements are presented in Indian rupees (rounded off to crore; one crore equals ten million). ## Transactions and translations\\n\\nForeign-currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities are translated into the relevant functional currency at exchange rates in effect at the Balance Sheet date. The gains or losses resulting from such translations are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss and reported within exchange gains / (losses) on translation of assets and liabilities, net, except when deferred in Other Comprehensive Income as qualifying cash flow hedges. Non-monetary assets and non-monetary liabilities denominated in a foreign currency and measured at fair value are translated at the exchange rate prevalent at the date when the fair value was determined. Nonmonetary assets and non-monetary liabilities denominated in a foreign currency and measured at historical cost are translated at the exchange rate prevalent at the date of transaction. The related revenue and expense are recognized using the same exchange rate. Transaction gains or losses realized upon settlement of foreign currency transactions are included in determining net profit for the period in which the transaction is settled. Revenue, expense and cash-flow items denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the relevant functional currencies using the exchange rate in effect on the date of the transaction. The translation of financial statements of the foreign subsidiaries to the presentation currency is performed for assets and liabilities using the exchange rate in effect at the Balance Sheet date and for revenue, expense and cash-flow items using the average exchange rate for the respective periods. The gains or losses resulting from such translation are included in currency translation reserves under other components of equity. When a subsidiary is disposed off, in full, the relevant amount is transferred to net profit in the consolidated statement of profit and loss. However when a change in the parent's ownership does not result in loss of control of a subsidiary, such changes are recorded through equity. Other Comprehensive Income, net of taxes includes translation differences on non-monetary financial assets measured at fair value at the reporting date, such as equities classified as financial instruments and measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI).\",\n",

A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Group assesses whether: (1) the contract involves the use of an identified asset (2) the Group has substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset through the period of the lease and (3) the Group has the right to direct the use of the asset. At the date of commencement of the lease, the Group recognizes a right-of-use asset ('ROU') and a corresponding lease liability for all lease arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for leases with a term of twelve months or less (short-term leases) and low value leases. For these short-term and low value leases, the Group recognizes the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. As a lessee, the Group determines the lease term as the noncancellable period of a lease adjusted with any option to extend or terminate the lease, if the use of such option is reasonably certain. The Group makes an assessment on the expected lease term on a lease-by-lease basis and thereby assesses whether it is reasonably certain that any options to extend or terminate the contract will be exercised. In evaluating the lease term, the Company considers factors such as any significant leasehold improvements undertaken over the lease term, costs relating to the termination of the lease and the importance of the underlying asset to Group's operations taking into account the location of the underlying asset and the availability of suitable alternatives. The lease term in future periods is reassessed to ensure that the lease term reflects the current economic circumstances. Certain lease arrangements include the options to extend or terminate the lease before the end of the lease term. ROU assets and lease liabilities includes these options when it is reasonably certain that they will be exercised. The ROU assets are initially recognized at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or prior to the commencement date of the lease plus any initial direct costs less any lease incentives. They are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. The ROU assets are depreciated from the commencement date on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and useful life of the underlying asset.\",\n",

For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the Cash Generating Unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs. The lease liability is initially measured at amortized cost at the present value of the future lease payments. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if not readily determinable, using the incremental borrowing rates in the country of domicile of these leases. Lease liabilities are remeasured with a corresponding adjustment to the related right of use asset if the Group changes its assessment if whether it will exercise an extension or a termination option. Lease liability and ROU assets have been separately presented in the Balance Sheet and lease payments have been classified as financing cash flows. ## The Group as a lessor\\n\\nLeases for which the Group is a lessor is classified as a finance or operating lease. Whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee, the contract is classified as a finance lease. All other leases are classified as operating leases. When the Group is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for its interests in the head lease and the sublease separately. The sublease is classified as a finance or operating lease by reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease. For operating leases, rental income is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease.\",\n",

(2) The average rate of increase in compensation levels is determined by the Company, considering factors such as, the Company's past compensation revision trends, inflation in respective markets and management's estimate of future salary increases. (3) Attrition rate considered is the Management's estimate based on the past long-term trend of employee turnover in the Company. The tenure has been considered taking into account the past long-term trend of employees' average remaining service life which reflects the average estimated term of postemployment benefit obligation. For domestic defined benefit plan in India, assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set in accordance with the published statistics by the Life Insurance Corporation of India. For overseas defined benefit plan, the assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set with regard to the latest statistics in life expectancy, plan experience and other relevant data. The Group assesses all of the above assumptions with its projected long-term plans of growth and prevalent industry standards. The Company contributes all ascertained liabilities towards gratuity to the Infosys Limited Employees' Gratuity Fund Trust. In case of Infosys BPM and EdgeVerve, contributions are made to the Infosys BPM Employees' Gratuity Fund Trust and EdgeVerve Systems Limited Employees Gratuity Fund Trust, respectively. Trustees administer contributions made to the trust as at March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, and contributions for gratuity are invested in a scheme with the Life Insurance Corporation of India as permitted by Indian law. The plan assets of the overseas defined benefit plan have been primarily invested in insurer managed funds and the asset allocation for plan assets is determined based on the investment criteria prescribed under the relevant regulations applicable to pension funds and the insurer managers. The insurers' investment are diversified and provide for guaranteed interest rates arrangements. Actual return on assets (including remeasurements) of the gratuity plan for the year ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 were \\u20b9145 crore and \\u20b9129 crore, respectively and for the pension plan were \\u20b936 crore and \\u20b9(91) crore, respectively.

If bond yields fall, the defined benefit obligation will tend to increase. Life expectancy and investment risk: The pension fund offers the choice between a lifelong pension and a cash lump sum upon retirement. The pension fund has defined rates for converting the lump sum to a pension and there is the risk that the members live longer than implied by these conversion rates and that the pension assets don't achieve the investment return implied by these conversion rates. Asset volatility: A proportion of the pension fund is held in equities, which is expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long term but give exposure to volatility and risk in the short term. The pension fund board of insurer is responsible for the investment strategy and equity allocation is justified given the long-term investment horizon of the pension fund and the objective to provide a reasonable long term return on members' account balances.\",\n",

Diluted earnings per equity share is computed by dividing the net profit attributable to the equity holders of the Group by the weighted average number of equity shares considered for deriving basic earnings per equity share and also the weighted average number of equity shares that could have been issued upon conversion of all dilutive potential equity shares. The dilutive potential equity shares are adjusted for the proceeds receivable had the equity shares been actually issued at fair value (i.e. the average market value of the outstanding equity shares). Dilutive potential equity shares are deemed converted as at the beginning of the period, unless issued at a later date. Dilutive potential equity shares are determined independently for each period presented. The number of equity shares and potentially dilutive equity shares are adjusted retrospectively for all periods presented for any share splits and bonus shares issues including for changes effected prior to the approval of the financial statements by the Board of Directors.\",\n",

McCamish initiated its incident response and engaged cybersecurity and other specialists to assist in its investigation of and response to the incident and remediation and restoration of impacted applications and systems. By December 31, 2023, McCamish, with external specialists' assistance, substantially remediated and restored the affected applications and systems. Loss of contracted revenues and costs incurred with respect to remediations, restoration, communication efforts, investigative processes and analysis, legal services and others amounted to $38 million (approximately \\u20b9316 crore). Actions taken by McCamish included investigative analysis conducted by a third-party cybersecurity firm to determine, among other things, whether and the extent to which company or customer data was subject to unauthorized access or exfiltration. McCamish also engaged a third-party eDiscovery vendor in assessing the extent and nature of such data. McCamish in coordination with its third-party eDiscovery vendor has identified corporate customers and individuals whose information was subject to unauthorized access and exfiltration. McCamish's review process is ongoing. McCamish may incur additional costs including indemnities or damages / claims, which are indeterminable at this time. On March 6, 2024, a class action complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia against McCamish . The complaint arises out of the cybersecurity incident at McCamish initially disclosed on November 3, 2023. The complaint was purportedly filed on behalf of all individuals within the United States whose personally identifiable information was exposed to unauthorized third parties as a result of the incident. ## 2.24.3 Legal proceedings\\n\\nApart from this, the Group is subject to legal proceedings and claims, which have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The Group's management reasonably expects that such ordinary course legal actions, when ultimately concluded and determined, will not have a material and adverse effect on the Group's results of operations or financial condition.\",\n",

The Group's operations predominantly relate to providing end-to-end business solutions to enable clients to enhance business performance. The Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) evaluates the Group's performance and allocates resources based on an analysis of various performance indicators by business segments. Accordingly, information has been presented along business segments. The accounting principles used in the preparation of the financial statements are consistently applied to record revenue and expenditure in individual segments, and are as set out in the accounting policies. Business segments of the Group are primarily enterprises in Financial Services and Insurance, enterprises in Manufacturing, enterprises in Retail, Consumer Packaged Goods and Logistics, enterprises in the Energy, Utilities, Resources and Services, enterprises in Communication, Telecom OEM and Media, enterprises in Hi-Tech, enterprises in Life Sciences and Healthcare and all other segments.\",\n",

All other segments represent the operating segments of businesses in India, Japan, China, Infosys Public Services and other enterprises in Public Services. Revenue and identifiable operating expenses in relation to segments are categorized based on items that are individually identifiable to that segment. Revenue for 'all other segments' represents revenue generated by Infosys Public services and revenue generated from customers located in India, Japan and China and other enterprises in Public Services. Allocated expenses of segments include expenses incurred for rendering services from the Group's offshore software development centers and on-site expenses, which are categorized in relation to the associated efforts of the segment. Certain expenses such as depreciation and amortization, which form a significant component of total expenses, are not specifically allocable to specific segments as the underlying assets are used interchangeably. The Management believes that it is not practical to provide segment disclosures relating to those costs and expenses, and accordingly these expenses are separately disclosed as \\\"unallocated\\\" and adjusted against the total income of the Group. Assets and liabilities used in the Group's business are not identified to any of the reportable segments, as these are used interchangeably between segments. The Management believes that it is currently not practicable to provide segment disclosures relating to total assets and liabilities since a meaningful segregation of the available data is onerous. Business segment revenue information is collated based on individual customers invoiced or in relation to which the revenue is otherwise recognized. Disclosure of revenue by geographic locations is given in Note 2.18, Revenue from operations.\",\n",
