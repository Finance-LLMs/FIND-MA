We seek to uphold our ambition of ‘zero waste to landfill’ through active minimization combined with technology investment in recycling and streamlining systems and processes. This year, we achieved TRUE Zero Waste Certification for our owned campuses in Bengaluru, Chennai Mcity and Pune Phase-2 through Green Business Certification Inc. (GBCI). The e-waste is always sent back to original manufacturers (under buyback schemes) or authorized recyclers who provide us certificates on the successful recycling and recovery of
the material. Other hazardous waste like biomedical waste, oil-soaked cotton, oil filters from DG sets, and other trash are designated by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)
and the State Pollution Control Board (SPCB). These agencies incinerate the waste in compliance with rules and regulations. The resulting ash is diverted for use in the production of
cement in a few places and delivered to Treatment, Storage, Disposal Facility (TSDF) landfills for safe disposal. 11. If the entity has operations / offices in / around ecologically sensitive areas (such as national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, biosphere reserves, wetlands, biodiversity

Independent Auditor’s Report
To The Members Of Infosys Limited
Report on the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying Standalone Financial Statements of INFOSYS LIMITED (the “Company”), which comprise the
Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2024, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes
in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended on that date and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of
material accounting policies and other explanatory information (hereinafter referred to as the “Standalone Financial Statements”)."
246,negative,0.9997463822364807,0.9997463822364807,0.0002485966542735696,5.00207443110412e-06,"In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid Standalone Financial
Statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view
in conformity with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under Section 133 of the Act, (“Ind AS”) and other accounting principles
generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2024 and its profit, total comprehensive income,
changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date. Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit of the Standalone Financial Statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (“SA”s) specified under
Section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit
of the Standalone Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics
issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit
of the Standalone Financial Statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other
ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence obtained
by us is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Standalone Financial Statements. Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the Standalone Financial
Statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have determined the
matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report. Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2023-24 205

Standalone Financial Statements
Sr. No. Key Audit Matter
1 Revenue recognition
The Company’s contracts with customers include contracts with multiple products and services. The Company derives
revenues from IT services comprising software development and related services, maintenance, consulting and package
implementation, licensing of software products and platforms across the Company’s core and digital offerings and business
process management services. The Company assesses the services promised in a contract and identifies distinct performance
obligations in the contract. Identification of distinct performance obligations to determine the deliverables and the ability of
the customer to benefit independently from such deliverables involves significant judgment."
247,negative,0.9992295503616333,0.9992295503616333,0.0007460277993232012,2.446837788738776e-05,"In certain integrated services arrangements, contracts with customers include subcontractor services or third-party vendor
equipment or software. In these types of arrangements, revenue from sales of third-party vendor products or services is
recorded net of costs when the Company is acting as an agent between the customer and the vendor, and gross when
the Company is the principal for the transaction. In doing so, the Company first evaluates whether it obtains control of the
specified goods or service before it is transferred to the customer. The Company considers whether it is primarily responsible
for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified goods or service, inventory risk, pricing discretion and other factors to
determine whether it controls the products or service and therefore, is acting as a principal or an agent. Fixed-price maintenance revenue is recognized ratably either on (1) a straight-line basis when services are performed
through an indefinite number of repetitive acts over a specified period or (2) using a percentage-of-completion method
when the pattern of benefits from the services rendered to the customer and the Company’s costs to fulfil the contract is
not even through the period of contract because the services are generally discrete in nature and not repetitive. The use of
method to recognize the maintenance revenues requires judgment and is based on the promises in the contract and nature
of the deliverables. As certain contracts with customers involve management’s judgment in (1) identifying distinct performance obligations,
(2) determining whether the Company is acting as a principal or an agent and (3) whether fixed-price maintenance revenue
is recognized on a straight-line basis or using the percentage-of-completion method, revenue recognition from these
judgments were identified as a key audit matter and required a higher extent of audit effort. Refer to Notes 1.4 and 2.18 to the Standalone Financial Statements. Auditor’s Response
Principal Audit Procedures Performed included the following:
Our audit procedures related to the (1) identification of distinct performance obligations, (2) determination of whether the
Company is acting as a principal or agent and (3) whether fixed-price maintenance revenue is recognized on a straight-line
basis or using the percentage-of-completion method included the following, among others:
• We tested the effectiveness of controls relating to the (a) identification of distinct performance obligations, (b)
determination of whether the Company is acting as a principal or an agent and (c) determination of whether fixed-price
maintenance revenue for certain contracts is recognized on a straight-line basis or using the percentage-of-completion
method."

– Obtained and read contract documents for each selection, including master service agreements, and other documents
that were part of the agreement. – Identified significant terms and deliverables in the contract to assess management’s conclusions regarding the (i)
identification of distinct performance obligations (ii) whether the Company is acting as a principal or an agent and (iii)
whether fixed-price maintenance revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis or using the percentage-of-completion
method. 206 Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2023-24

2 Revenue recognition – Fixed-price contracts using the percentage-of-completion method
Fixed-price maintenance revenue is recognized ratably either (1) on a straight-line basis when services are performed through
an indefinite number of repetitive acts over a specified period or (2) using a percentage-of-completion method when the
pattern of benefits from services rendered to the customer and the Company’s costs to fulfil the contract is not even through
the period of contract because the services are generally discrete in nature and not repetitive. Revenue from other fixed-price,
fixed-timeframe contracts, where the performance obligations are satisfied over time is recognized using the percentage-
of-completion method. Use of the percentage-of-completion method requires the Company to determine the actual efforts or costs expended
to date as a proportion of the estimated total efforts or costs to be incurred. Efforts or costs expended have been used to
measure progress towards completion as there is a direct relationship between input and productivity. The estimation of total
efforts or costs involves significant judgment and is assessed throughout the period of the contract to reflect any changes
based on the latest available information. Provisions for estimated losses, if any, on uncompleted contracts are recorded in the
period in which such losses become probable based on the estimated efforts or costs to complete the contract. We identified the estimate of total efforts or costs to complete fixed-price contracts measured using the percentage-
of-completion method as a key audit matter as the estimation of total efforts or costs involves significant judgment and
is assessed throughout the period of the contract to reflect any changes based on the latest available information. This
estimate has a high inherent uncertainty and requires consideration of progress of the contract, efforts or costs incurred
to-date and estimates of efforts or costs required to complete the remaining contract performance obligations over the
term of the contracts."
249,negative,0.9995357990264893,0.9995357990264893,1.8869135601562448e-05,0.0004453753645066172,"This required a high degree of auditor judgment in evaluating the audit evidence and a higher extent of audit effort to
evaluate the reasonableness of the total estimated amount of revenue recognized on fixed-price contracts. Refer to Notes 1.4 and 2.18 to the Standalone Financial Statements. Auditor’s Response
Principal Audit Procedures Performed included the following:
Our audit procedures related to estimates of total expected costs or efforts to complete for fixed-price contracts included the
following, among others:
• We tested the effectiveness of controls relating to (1) recording of efforts or costs incurred and estimation of efforts
or costs required to complete the remaining contract performance obligations and (2) access and application controls
pertaining to time recording, allocation and budgeting systems, which prevents unauthorised changes to recording of
efforts incurred. • We selected a sample of fixed-price contracts with customers measured using the percentage-of-completion method and
performed the following:
– Evaluated management’s ability to reasonably estimate the progress towards satisfying the performance obligation
by comparing actual efforts or costs incurred to prior year estimates of efforts or costs budgeted for performance
obligations that have been fulfilled. – Compared efforts or costs incurred with Company’s estimate of efforts or costs incurred to date to identify significant
variations and evaluate whether those variations have been considered appropriately in estimating the remaining costs
or efforts to complete the contract. – Tested the estimate for consistency with the status of delivery of milestones and customer acceptances and sign off
from customers to identify possible delays in achieving milestones, which require changes in estimated costs or efforts
to complete the remaining performance obligations. Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2023-24 207

Standalone Financial Statements
Information Other than the Financial Statements and Auditor’s Report Thereon
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included
in the Management Discussion and Analysis, Board’s Report, including Annexures to Board’s Report, Business Responsibility and
Sustainability Report, Corporate Governance and Shareholder’s Information, but does not include the consolidated financial statements,
Standalone Financial Statements and our Auditor’s Report thereon. Our opinion on the Standalone Financial Statements does not cover the other information and, we do not express any form of
assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the Standalone Financial Statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so,
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the Standalone Financial Statements or our knowledge obtained
during the course of our audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated."

report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Standalone Financial Statements
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in Section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation of
these Standalone Financial Statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance, including Other
Comprehensive Income, Changes in Equity and Cash Flows of the Company in accordance with the accounting principles generally
accepted in India, including Ind AS specified under Section 133 of the Act. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate
accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Company and for preventing
and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and
estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that
were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and
presentation of the Standalone Financial Statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether
due to fraud or error. In preparing the Standalone Financial Statements, management and Board of Directors is responsible for assessing the Company’s
ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern
basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic
alternative but to do so. The Company’s Board of Directors is also responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process. Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Standalone Financial Statements as a whole are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an Auditor’s Report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high
level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement
when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Standalone Financial Statements. As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism
throughout the audit."

• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Standalone Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error, design
and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from
error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. • Obtain an understanding of internal financial control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate
in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Company
has adequate internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements in place and the operating effectiveness
of such controls. • Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures
made by the management. • Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence
obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s
ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our
Auditor’s Report to the related disclosures in the Standalone Financial Statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify
our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our Auditor’s Report. However, future events
or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. 208 Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2023-24

• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Standalone Financial Statements, including the disclosures, and
whether the Standalone Financial Statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair
presentation. Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the Standalone Financial Statements that, individually or in aggregate, makes it
probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the Standalone Financial Statements may be influenced. We consider quantitative materiality and qualitative factors in (i) planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our
work; and (ii) to evaluate the effect of any identified misstatements in the Standalone Financial Statements. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and
significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal financial controls that we identify during our audit."

independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our
independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the
audit of the Standalone Financial Statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in
our Auditor’s Report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we
determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be
expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication. Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements

The Company’s Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls with reference to Standalone
Financial Statements based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Company considering the
essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting
issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (the “ICAI”). These responsibilities include the design, implementation and
maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct
of its business, including adherence to Company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds
and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as
required under the Act. Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial
Statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls
Over Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) issued by the ICAI and the Standards on Auditing prescribed under Section 143(10) of the
Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements. Those Standards
and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether adequate internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements was established and maintained
and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects. Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls with
reference to Standalone Financial Statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with reference
to Standalone Financial Statements included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls with reference to Standalone
Financial Statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the
Company’s internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements. Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements
A Company's internal financial control with reference to Standalone Financial Statements is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles."

Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper
management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any

Accounting policy
Intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment. Intangible assets are amortized over their respective
individual estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis, from the date that they are available for use. The estimated useful life of an
identifiable intangible asset is based on a number of factors, including the effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, and other
economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, and known technological advances), and the level of maintenance expenditures
required to obtain the expected future cash flows from the asset. Amortization methods and useful lives are reviewed periodically
including at each financial year end. Research costs are expensed as incurred. Software product development costs are expensed as incurred unless technical and
commercial feasibility of the project is demonstrated, future economic benefits are probable, the Company has an intention and ability
to complete and use or sell the software and the costs can be measured reliably. The costs, which can be capitalized include the cost of
material, direct labor, overhead costs that are directly attributable to prepare the asset for its intended use."

Independent Auditor’s Report
To The Members of Infosys Limited
Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of INFOSYS LIMITED (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries
(the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the “Group”) which comprise the Consolidated Balance Sheet as at March
31, 2024, and the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Consolidated Statement of
Changes in Equity and the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended on that date, and notes to the financial statements,
including a summary of material accounting policies and other explanatory information (hereinafter referred to as the “Consolidated
Financial Statements”)."

Statements, give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair
view in conformity with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act, (“Ind AS”) and other accounting
principles generally accepted in India, of the consolidated state of affairs of the Group as at March 31, 2024 and their consolidated
profit, their consolidated total comprehensive income, their consolidated changes in equity and their consolidated cash flows for the
year ended on that date. Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (“SAs”) specified under
section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit
of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the Code of Ethics
issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of
the Consolidated Financial Statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other
ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence obtained
by us is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements. Emphasis of Matter
As described in note 2.24.2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, certain costs relating to possible damages or claims relating to a
cybersecurity incident in a subsidiary are indeterminable as at the date of this report because of reasons stated in the note. Our opinion
is not modified in respect of this matter. Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the Consolidated
Financial Statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the Consolidated Financial
Statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have
determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report. 288 Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2023-24

1 Revenue recognition
The Group’s contracts with customers include contracts with multiple products and services."
361,negative,0.9990111589431763,0.9990111589431763,0.0009585618390701711,3.0260114726843312e-05,"The group derives
revenues from IT services comprising software development and related services, maintenance, consulting and package
implementation, licensing of software products and platforms across the Group’s core and digital offerings and business
process management services. The Group assesses the services promised in a contract and identifies distinct performance
obligations in the contract. Identification of distinct performance obligations to determine the deliverables and the ability of
the customer to benefit independently from such deliverables involves significant judgement. In certain integrated services arrangements, contracts with customers include subcontractor services or third-party vendor
equipment or software. In these types of arrangements, revenue from sales of third-party vendor products or services is
recorded net of costs when the Group is acting as an agent between the customer and the vendor, and gross when the Group
is the principal for the transaction. In doing so, the Group first evaluates whether it obtains control of the specified goods
or services before it is transferred to the customer. The Group considers whether it is primarily responsible for fulfilling the
promise to provide the specified goods or services, inventory risk, pricing discretion and other factors to determine whether
it controls the products or service and therefore, is acting as a principal or an agent. Fixed price maintenance revenue is recognized ratably either on (1) a straight-line basis when services are performed through
an indefinite number of repetitive acts over a specified period or (2) using a percentage of completion method when the
pattern of benefits from the services rendered to the customer and the Group’s costs to fulfil the contract is not even through
the period of contract because the services are generally discrete in nature and not repetitive. The use of method to recognize
the maintenance revenues requires judgment and is based on the promises in the contract and nature of the deliverables. As certain contracts with customers involve management’s judgment in (1) identifying distinct performance obligations,
(2) determining whether the Group is acting as a principal or an agent and (3) whether fixed price maintenance revenue
is recognized on a straight-line basis or using the percentage of completion method, revenue recognition from these
judgments were identified as a key audit matter and required a higher extent of audit effort. Refer Notes 1.5 and 2.18 to the consolidated financial statements."

Our audit procedures related to the (1) identification of distinct performance obligations, (2) determination of whether the
Group is acting as a principal or agent and (3) whether fixed price maintenance revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis
or using the percentage of completion method included the following, among others:
• We tested the effectiveness of controls relating to the (a) identification of distinct performance obligations, (b)
determination of whether the Group is acting as a principal or an agent and (c) determination of whether fixed price
maintenance revenue for certain contracts is recognized on a straight-line basis or using the percentage of completion
method. • We selected a sample of contracts with customers and performed the following procedures:
– Obtained and read contract documents for each selection, including master service agreements, and other documents
that were part of the agreement. – Identified significant terms and deliverables in the contract to assess management’s conclusions regarding the (i)
identification of distinct performance obligations (ii) whether the Group is acting as a principal or an agent and (iii)
whether fixed price maintenance revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis or using the percentage of completion
method. Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2023-24 289

2 Revenue recognition - Fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method
Fixed price maintenance revenue is recognized ratably either (1) on a straight-line basis when services are performed through
an indefinite number of repetitive acts over a specified period or (2) using a percentage of completion method when the
pattern of benefits from services rendered to the customer and the Group’s costs to fulfil the contract is not even through the
period of contract because the services are generally discrete in nature and not repetitive. Revenue from other fixed-price,
fixed-timeframe contracts, where the performance obligations are satisfied over time is recognized using the percentage-
of-completion method. Use of the percentage-of-completion method requires the Group to determine the actual efforts or costs expended to date
as a proportion of the estimated total efforts or costs to be incurred. Efforts or costs expended have been used to measure
progress towards completion as there is a direct relationship between input and productivity. The estimation of total efforts
or costs involves significant judgement and is assessed throughout the period of the contract to reflect any changes based on
the latest available information."

which such losses become probable based on the estimated efforts or costs to complete the contract. We identified the estimate of total efforts or costs to complete fixed price contracts measured using the percentage of
completion method as a key audit matter as the estimation of total efforts or costs involves significant judgement and
is assessed throughout the period of the contract to reflect any changes based on the latest available information. This
estimate has a high inherent uncertainty and requires consideration of progress of the contract, efforts or costs incurred
to-date and estimates of efforts or costs required to complete the remaining contract performance obligations over the
term of the contracts. This required a high degree of auditor judgment in evaluating the audit evidence and a higher extent of audit effort to
evaluate the reasonableness of the total estimated amount of revenue recognized on fixed-price contracts. Refer Notes 1.5 and 2.18 to the consolidated financial statements. Auditor’s Response
Principal Audit Procedures Performed included the following:
Our audit procedures related to estimates of total expected costs or efforts to complete for fixed-price contracts included the
following, among others:
• We tested the effectiveness of controls relating to (1) recording of efforts or costs incurred and estimation of efforts
or costs required to complete the remaining contract performance obligations and (2) access and application controls
pertaining to time recording, allocation and budgeting systems which prevents unauthorised changes to recording of
efforts incurred. • We selected a sample of fixed price contracts with customers measured using the percentage-of-completion method and
performed the following:
– Evaluated management’s ability to reasonably estimate the progress towards satisfying the performance obligation
by comparing actual efforts or costs incurred to prior year estimates of efforts or costs budgeted for performance
obligations that have been fulfilled. – Compared efforts or costs incurred with Group’s estimate of efforts or costs incurred to date to identify significant
variations and evaluate whether those variations have been considered appropriately in estimating the remaining costs
or efforts to complete the contract. – Tested the estimate for consistency with the status of delivery of milestones and customer acceptances and sign off
from customers to identify possible delays in achieving milestones, which require changes in estimated costs or efforts
to complete the remaining performance obligations. 290 Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2023-24

The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation and
presentation of these consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position, consolidated
financial performance including other comprehensive income, consolidated changes in equity and consolidated cash flows of the Group

responsible for assessing the ability of the respective entities to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to
going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the respective Boards of Directors either intends to liquidate their
respective entities or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. The respective Boards of Directors/Trustees of the entities included in the Group are also responsible for overseeing the financial
reporting process of the Group. Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high
level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement
when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism
throughout the audit. We also:
• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design
and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from

or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern. • Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and
whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair
presentation. • Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities within the Group to express an
opinion on the consolidated financial statements. Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the consolidated financial statements that, individually or in aggregate, makes it
probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the consolidated financial statements may be influenced. We consider quantitative materiality and qualitative factors in (i) planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our
work; and (ii) to evaluate the effect of any identified misstatements in the consolidated financial statements. We communicate with those charged with governance of the Company and such other entities included in the consolidated financial
statements of which we are the independent auditors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and
significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal financial controls that we identify during our audit. We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding
independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our
independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the
audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in
our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we
determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be
expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication."

The respective Boards of Directors of the Company and its subsidiary companies, which are companies incorporated in India, are
responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria
established by the respective Companies considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on
Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (the “ICAI”). These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating
effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to the respective company’s policies, the
safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records,
and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Act. Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements of the
Company and its subsidiary companies, which are companies incorporated in India, based on our audit. We conducted our audit in
accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) issued by the
Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”) and the Standards on Auditing, prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the
extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements. Those Standards and the
Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether adequate internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements was established and maintained and if
such controls operated effectively in all material respects. Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls with reference
to consolidated financial statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with reference to
consolidated financial statements included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls with reference to consolidated
financial statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the
internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary companies, which are
companies incorporated in India."

Consolidated Financial Statements
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements
A company's internal financial control with reference to consolidated financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal financial control with reference to consolidated financial statements
includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts
and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company;
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements, including the
possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not
be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements to
future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control with reference to consolidated financial statements may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Opinion
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the Company and its subsidiary
companies, which are companies incorporated in India, have, in all material respects, an adequate internal financial controls system with
reference to consolidated financial statements and such internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements
were operating effectively as at March 31, 2024, based on the criteria for internal financial control with reference to consolidated financial
statements established by the respective companies considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance
Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the ICAI. For DELOITTE HASKINS & SELLS LLP

investing or financing cash flows. The cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities of the Group are segregated. The

2.26 Segment reporting
Ind AS 108, Operating segments, establishes standards for the way that public business enterprises report information about operating
segments and related disclosures about products and services, geographic areas, and major customers. The Group's operations
predominantly relate to providing end-to-end business solutions to enable clients to enhance business performance. The Chief
Operating Decision Maker (CODM) evaluates the Group's performance and allocates resources based on an analysis of various
performance indicators by business segments. Accordingly, information has been presented along business segments. The accounting
principles used in the preparation of the financial statements are consistently applied to record revenue and expenditure in individual
segments, and are as set out in the accounting policies. Business segments of the Group are primarily enterprises in Financial Services and Insurance, enterprises in Manufacturing, enterprises
in Retail, Consumer Packaged Goods and Logistics, enterprises in the Energy, Utilities, Resources and Services, enterprises in
Communication, Telecom OEM and Media, enterprises in Hi-Tech, enterprises in Life Sciences and Healthcare and all other segments. The
Financial services reportable segments has been aggregated to include the Financial Services operating segment and Finacle operating
segment because of the similarity of the economic characteristics. All other segments represent the operating segments of businesses in
India, Japan, China, Infosys Public Services and other enterprises in Public Services. Revenue and identifiable operating expenses in relation to segments are categorized based on items that are individually identifiable
to that segment. Revenue for 'all other segments' represents revenue generated by Infosys Public services and revenue generated from
customers located in India, Japan and China and other enterprises in Public Services."

incurred for rendering services from the Group's offshore software development centers and on-site expenses, which are categorized
in relation to the associated efforts of the segment. Certain expenses such as depreciation and amortization, which form a significant
component of total expenses, are not specifically allocable to specific segments as the underlying assets are used interchangeably. The
Management believes that it is not practical to provide segment disclosures relating to those costs and expenses, and accordingly these
expenses are separately disclosed as ""unallocated"" and adjusted against the total income of the Group. Assets and liabilities used in the Group's business are not identified to any of the reportable segments, as these are used interchangeably
between segments. The Management believes that it is currently not practicable to provide segment disclosures relating to total assets
and liabilities since a meaningful segregation of the available data is onerous. Business segment revenue information is collated based on individual customers invoiced or in relation to which the revenue is
otherwise recognized. Disclosure of revenue by geographic locations is given in Note 2.18, Revenue from operations."
